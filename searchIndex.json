Many workplaces still consider weekend communication a big no-no. Meanwhile, fast-paced startups and research labs often expect you to live and breathe your projects around the clock. At ratio1.ai, we say there’s a happy middle ground - and it doesn’t involve feeling guilty when inspiration strikes at 2 a.m. on a Saturday.","In many well-established corporations (especially those with ironclad employee protections), it’s basically illegal - or at least severely frowned upon - to send that weekend Slack message. Their reasoning goes something like this:","Well-being matters and that’s pretty obvious as burnt-out employees get grumpy, and grumpy employees make mistakes (which nobody wants).","Legal stuff (boring) yet some jurisdictions actually forbid non-urgent weekend pinging. Think of it as “the law says we need our beauty sleep.”","Employee satisfaction - in these corporations culture is a surefire way to keep people happy is letting them turn off notifications. Shocking, right?","Now let’s flip that script. First of all I’ll admit I’m personally biased towards this part as I’ve spent 25+ good years in this environment - think of it as the Battle of the Bastards in Game of Thrones and John Snow running towards the enemies… Enough banter, let's discuss this approach. Many hot-ticket startups, bad a$$ disruptive scale-ups, research labs, and forward-thinking organizations actually thrive on round-the-clock creativity based on three basic pillars: iteration, flexibility and passion. You pick the order.","Continuous iteration (ie “The Struggle”) - build, break, and rebuild - fast. Elon Musk famously touts the “no one ever changed the world on 40 hours a week” mantra, which might mean your team is revving its engines at all hours.","If your creative juices flow best at midnight, go for it - and that means Flexible Schedules. If you’d rather run errands at noon, do it. Teams that prioritize agility give everyone room to shine.","Last but not least Passion: when people genuinely care about their projects, the line between “work” and “life” can get fuzzy. (But in a good way, we promise.)","Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX): Known for pushing the 80-100 hour workweeks. He doesn’t just talk the talk - he’s probably building something while you’re reading this.","Jeff Bezos (Amazon): Prefers “work-life harmony” to strict boundaries, letting people find their own groove. (It’s also a handy way to describe that dance between big ideas and personal time.)","Satya Nadella (Microsoft): Champions empathy and flexibility, acknowledging you can’t just innovate on zero sleep. He’s an advocate for the “intense sprints, balanced by actual rest” philosophy.","At ratio1.ai, we firmly believe the extremes - 24/7 “always on” or complete weekend radio silence - can ultimately lead to either burnout or stalled innovation. Instead, let’s talk about that comfy sweet spot:","Empower choiceIf someone’s on a creative roll at 6 p.m. on a Saturday, they should feel free to run with it. If they’d rather be binge-watching the latest series, that’s cool too.","Respect boundariesUse “no rush” labels or schedule messages for Monday if it’s not urgent. That way, teammates can focus on that epic family board game night without feeling pressured to whip out their laptops.","Sustain productivityResearch shows that strategic downtime can actually improve creativity. Yes, it’s true - our brains sometimes solve problems while we’re napping, hiking, or daydreaming.","We believe genuine innovation stems from passion, autonomy, and trust. We encourage a culture where, in the words of Antoine de Saint-Exupery “It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important”:","Originality is king: Keep tinkering on that side project if it fuels your creativity","Personal responsibility rules: You know when you’re at your best - work then, rest when you need it.","Well-being can’t be faked: A team running on empty isn’t likely to disrupt the status quo. So go ahead, power down once in a while.","Striking the balance between high-octane innovation and real-life downtime can be tricky, but it’s totally doable. At ratio1.ai, we treat flexibility and trust like superpowers in our quest to build cutting-edge tech - and keep our team energized and happy. So the next time a lightbulb goes off in your head on a weekend, let it shine. Just remember, nobody’s going to blame you if you also choose to snooze that Slack/Google/Notion/Whetever notification until Monday morning. Innovation is a marathon, not a sprint. Yet while it certainly doesn’t have to be an endless Monday through Sunday grind we do have our occasional 100m races.","Race (build) on!","Andrei Ionut Damian","Jan 11, 2025","‹ Introducing dAuth: Simplified, Decentralized Authentication in Ratio1","Test Code Remotely with Ratio1 – Build Your Own Sandbox in Minutes ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

Today, we’re thrilled to introduce dAuth - a new service designed to handle decentralized authentication effortlessly for both the Naeural SDK and Edge Nodes. By eliminating the typical headaches of environment variables, password management, and manual configurations, dAuth brings us one step closer to our ultimate vision: AI power to the people - fast, affordable, and easy to access.","Side Note: Although Ratio1 is built on the underlying Naeural Edge Protocol technology, we are consolidating our branding to Ratio1. That means we’ll be referring to everything in our ecosystem - SDK, Edge Nodes, and so on - under the single Ratio1 name going forward. Well, we might occasionally and affectionately call the SDK with Naeural Edge Protocol SDK so please forgive us in advance:)","Most AI solutions and microservices require complex configurations just to communicate securely - think multiple passwords, ports, or even entire DevOps workflows. In the Naeural ecosystem, we wanted something better: a trustless and automated way to onboard new participants, whether they’re running our SDK or spinning up an Edge Node. That’s where dAuth comes in.","Multiple credentials: Managing countless keys, passwords, or certificates.","Manual steps: Endless CLI commands or config files for each environment.","Fragile setups: Risk of human error or mismatched versions when rolling out updates.","Major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have solutions for automating and managing application credentials - e.g., AWS IAM roles, Azure Managed Identities, or GCP Service Accounts. However, those are centrally controlled within each provider’s ecosystem and typically require manual setup of policies, environment variables, and keys. By contrast, dAuth is decentralized and automatically provisions/authenticates each new instance using a private key with on-chain validation (for Edge Nodes), reducing the traditional overhead of configuring and rotating credentials.","Automated key generation: No more manual provisioning - each SDK or Node gets a unique private key.","On-chain validation: Edge Nodes must have valid on-chain licenses; SDK clients get immediate access to dev subnets.","Decentralized endpoint: dAuth scales horizontally across the network, meaning no single point of failure.","Here’s a quick rundown of the dAuth flow that kicks in the moment you launch a Node or SDK instance:","InstantiationWhen you start a fresh Ratio1 SDK (formerly known as Naeural Edge Protocol SDK) instance or spin up a Ratio1 Edge Node, it automatically generates a unique private key and protocol address.","Signed RequestUsing the SDK or Edge Node private key, the instance signs a request and sends it to a decentralized endpoint - dAuth - whose replicas live in the ratio1 (Ratio1) network.","Permission CheckThe dAuth service checks whether:","The Edge Node holds a valid on-chain license that has the Edge Node address assigned to it (each Edge Node elliptic curve keys have both internal node address as well as EVM-compatible address).","The SDK is allowed initial access to dev subnets. Same keys and addresses as with the Edge Node - no licence required though.","Secure Auth Info DeliveryIf the checks pass, dAuth securely delivers the necessary authentication and authorization data back to the Node/SDK. This effectively says, “You’re in. Let’s get you online.”","Network AccessAt this point, the Node or SDK seamlessly connects to the Ratio1 network, letting you skip the usual tedious “ports, secrets, and environment variable” dance.","The easiest way to get started with the pre-launch version of our Edge Node is via Docker. Give it a whirl:","This command kicks off a container that during the boot operation will generate a keypair for your Node, communicate with the dAuth endpoint, verify and secure your Node’s connection to the network - no manual config needed.","If you’d rather test out the Ratio1 SDK on your local machine, simply grab it via pip:","Once installed, try checking for active testnet nodes near you:","That’s it. If everything’s working, you’ll see a list of available nodes in the ratio1 testnet. dAuth has already done the heavy lifting of authenticating your SDK instance behind the scenes.","dAuth is just the latest chapter in Ratio1’s ongoing mission to “democratize AI” and bring a new level of usability to decentralized technology. Combined with our no-code/low-code tools, automated deployment, and edge computing infrastructure, dAuth ensures anyone can participate - without having to juggle config files or DevOps overhead.","For Developers: dAuth means you can focus on building, not babysitting credentials.","For Edge Node Operators: Spin up a Node and monetize your hardware without tedious onboarding steps.","For Non-Technical Users: Enjoy frictionless AI experiences - no complicated secrets or ports to remember. No-password deployment for a No-code platform 🙂","We are fully aware that no system is without risks, and dAuth is no exception so the main issue would be related to your private keys.","Key Management: Any compromise of your private key could expose your Node or SDK to unauthorized use. Adequate security measures are essential and this holds totally true for your Wallet seed phrase, right?!?","Limited Access: We are trying to limit access to the auto generated private keys but this does not stop anyone from accessing them and copying them to unsecured “hot” locations. Again, the same holds true for your cryptocurrency wallets private keys…Right?","Despite these potential issues, dAuth’s design aims to minimize attack surfaces by automating key generation and permission checks in a decentralized manner, thus reducing manual errors and single points of failure.","We’re incredibly excited to see how dAuth fuels the next wave of AI applications deployment, from simple testnet experiments to production-scale microservices. By removing authentication hurdles and letting the network handle security and permission checks, dAuth paves the way for developers, operators, and end-users to innovate freely.","So go ahead:","Run that docker run naeural/edge_node:develop","Install the naeural_client via pip","Explore the network with nepctl get nodes --online","And most importantly, have fun building the AI future with Ratio1 - where complicated configurations are a thing of the past, and frictionless, trustless innovation is just a few clicks away.","Stay tuned for more updates, and let us know how Ratio1 is helping you simplify your AI journey.

That’s exactly what Codename: J33VE5 delivers: a decentralized, user-owned personal assistant designed to run securely on the Ratio1 network.","With J33VE5, your conversation history, browsing data, personal documents - any piece of information you choose to integrate - stays fully encrypted and accessible only via your private keys. Everything is distributed and backed up on the blockchain-based infrastructure of the Ratio1 network. Gone are the days of relying on centralized servers that might sell your data to advertisers or keep it under murky terms. Instead, J33VE5 puts you in the driver’s seat: you own not only your data, but also the foundation models that power its responses and actions.","By leveraging state-of-the-art open-weights Large Language Models (LLMs), J33VE5 can draw on your entire history to give answers and suggestions specifically tailored to your needs - no more one-size-fits-all approaches. Think of asking for a workout routine that factors in your past fitness goals, dietary preferences, calendar availability, or even mood patterns. J33VE5’s security model uses the same protocols that protect your Ethereum (ETH) holdings, ensuring your personal interactions remain as secure as digital assets in your wallet. With no central authority in charge, your data isn’t mined for profit or twisted by hidden agendas. Instead, J33VE5 embodies a radically fresh vision where autonomy, trust, and personalization converge, creating a digital companion that puts your interests front and center.","For developers eager to build on this next-generation paradigm, J33VE5 offers an advanced toolkit that makes creating specialized, domain-focused assistants both seamless and creatively empowering. You can craft unique AI “personalities” for virtually any sector - envision a paralegal agent that references legal precedents or a banking agent that interacts securely with complex APIs. These assistants aren’t mere wrappers around an LLM; they are fully realized digital experts integrated with the real world and specialized datasets.","Picture a booking agent that negotiates with travel platforms, updates your calendar in real time, pulls the latest market data for cost comparisons, and even manages e-commerce inventories - all under the core ethos of decentralized control and user-centric data ownership. The underlying framework lets developers:","Integrate custom APIs and data streams without worrying about compromised security.","Adapt to domain-specific tasks, so each agent can handle intricate real-world workflows.","Embed advanced knowledge gleaned from user history while maintaining tight data privacy through user-owned encryption keys.","In this environment, the toolkit acts as a framework upon which developers can layer their own integrations, user interface elements, and access protocols. By doing so, it becomes possible to deliver assistants that not only carry the knowledge gleaned from a user’s historical data but also adapt and respond to the intricacies of domain-specific tasks. A paralegal assistant, for instance, could reference a client’s past case files, organizational charts, or compliance standards without ever risking that sensitive information falls into the wrong hands. Every interaction is steered by user-owned encryption keys and designed to maintain absolute security.","This approach fosters a developer community that values privacy, domain specialization, and user-centric design, so instead of scrambling to fit within the limitations of a centralized AI solution, developers can mold their agents to address nuanced real-world challenges and evolving business logic. The result is an ecosystem of independently developed, interoperable assistants that stand as more than mere chatbots - they are fully realized, contextual experts who can operate with intelligence, agility, and trustworthiness. In short, \"Codename: J33VE5\" has the potential to offer developers the creative freedom, technical muscle, and (probably more important) the ethical alignment needed to usher in a new generation of AI-based digital companions, each one distinct, each one secure, and each one designed to meaningfully improve the lives of the users it serves.","J33VE5 runs on the Ratio1 Edge Node infrastructure, a decentralized environment designed to tackle security, availability, development, and deployment challenges head-on. Here’s a deeper look at some of its key components:","Chain-StoreA decentralized, (“Redis-like” if you want) key-value store API that allows for peer-to-peer data-variable sharing at the application plugin level. Think of it as in-memory data distribution without the single point of failure (actually securely encrypted and distributed on tens of supervisor high-secure nodes).","dAuthA secure authentication system for both nodes and individual pipelines (applications) and their plugins. It ensures that any interaction - whether a node handshake or app-level function - is validated in a trustless fashion.","R1-IPFS APIThis is where private and secure decentralized IPFS-based storage comes into play. You get a blockchain-backed, fully distributed means of storing and retrieving files or datasets with privacy baked in.","Neuro-Symbolic Heuristics & ModelsAlongside the pre-trained LLMs, J33VE5 supports a range of non-LLM models and neuro-symbolic heuristics that allow for advanced computations and real-time decision-making - perfect for specialized business logic.","All these pieces work in tandem to abstract away the complexities of decentralized load balancing, data encryption, and trustless authentication, letting you - whether a developer or end user - focus on building or using robust AI solutions. Beyond J33VE5 and LLM agents, our goal is to provide a powerful toolset to build almost any kind of application and even migrate classic legacy applications to our decentralized environment.","At launch, J33VE5 starts as a conversation-first agent. But the roadmap is ambitious: soon, it will handle real-world asset interaction either natively or via third-party extensions. For instance, if you want your assistant to coordinate travel, J33VE5 can securely access your airline miles, hotel memberships, past trip notes, and even payment details, enabling you to finalize bookings with a single command. That’s convenience and user ownership in one neat package.","Whether you’re a decentralized tech enthusiast, a busy professional looking for a powerful AI companion, or someone who prioritizes digital privacy, J33VE5 represents a major leap forward. Instead of juggling multiple platforms, you’ll rely on a personal AI butler attuned to your routines, preferences, and lifestyle, all while keeping your data where it belongs: with you.","Ratio1 extends developer empowerment further by embedding a token-based economy at the heart of its ecosystem - a dynamic approach that encourages a community of builders to launch and monetize their specialized assistants or extensions through the $R1 token. By weaving in a token model from day one, Ratio1 ensures that creators of code, AI models, or domain-specific logic share in the ecosystem’s success. Every new feature, optimization, or extension not only boosts the overall platform’s capabilities but also expands revenue opportunities for contributors.","This creates a self-sustaining cycle where end users enjoy continuously improving tools and developers are incentivized to keep enhancing the platform, further driving adoption and innovation. As a result, Ratio1 fosters a vibrant, ever-evolving community of users, developers, and investors who all stand to benefit from the growth and success of the $R1 token and the broader network.","With Ratio1 mainnet just around the corner, the stage is set for a new era of decentralized AI. Whether you’re simply looking to provide & monetize your spare compute or aiming to build next-gen AI apps with low-code tools - or both - there’s a place for you in the Ratio1 ecosystem.","So, Ratio1 mainnet is almost here, choose your role:","User – provide & monetize your spare compute and storage resources while enjoying the benefits of R1 applications such as a decentralized personal assistant","Developer – Build next-gen AI decentralized apps (with or without J33VE5 SDK) with our low-code tools","...Or embrace both roles","Stay connected with Ratio1 for further updates and tutorials on how to launch your own J33VE5 agent or integrate it into your business logic.

Let’s walk through the high-level user flow to see how everything ties together, focusing on where the user gets involved and what to expect when interacting with the system.","Name: Ratio1, Symbol: R1 with maximum supply: 161,803,398 tokens.","Only the ND (Node Deed) and MND (Master Node Deed) contracts can mint new tokens, which is essential for the functioning of the ecosystem, as it rewards node operators for keeping their nodes online.","We also have a list of addresses that can burn the token, which comprehends the ND contract and will include other ecosystem smart contracts that were not live at the moment of the ecosystem deployment such as PoAI.","For maximum security, the owner of the contract can set the address for both the ND and MND contracts only once, ensuring that no unexpected change to the tokenomics can happen.

Each license can eventually generate R1 rewards if the user “runs a node” and periodically claims.","Buying a License:","User calls buyLicense(...) and provides:","The number of licenses to buy.","A limit on how many R1 tokens they are willing to pay per license (maxAcceptedTokenPerLicense).","The percentage of VAT to apply","A signed message (“invoice UUID”, plus a usdMintLimit and VAT percentage) from an authorized signer.","Contract checks the signature is valid (and not previously used).","It retrieves the R1 token price from the DEX (ILiquidityManager.getTokenPrice()), converts the license’s USD cost to R1 cost, and ensures the user’s maxAcceptedTokenPerLicense is not exceeded.","The user transfers that many R1 tokens to NDContract, including the percentage needed for VAT given by the backend..","NDContract then:","Burns 20%.","Sends 50% to liquidity.","A percentage of this amount, defined by a directAddLpPercentage storage, is automatically added to the Uniswap V2 USDC/R1 LP","The rest is sent to the LP Company Wallet","Sends the remaining 30% to the main wallet or among a set of organization wallets","NDContract mints the requested number of ERC721 licenses to the buyer.","The buy license also has a mechanism in place to protect buyers from high price swings: if the price changes more than 10% in an hour from the last buy, the buy will fail, ensuring fairness and protecting from MEV and other forms of attacks.","Linking a Node:","Each license can be linked to a “node address” via linkNode(...).","Only one license can be linked to a node address at a time, and the license cannot be reassigned for 24 hours.","If the license was previously linked to a node, it calls an internal _removeNodeAddress to unlink the old node first.","For compliance reasons, the user must also have passed the KYC/KYB to be able to link its node to a license, ensuring that even users who bought from secondary markets are identified in the ecosystem.","Unlinking a Node:","The license owner can choose to unlink the license from their “node address”.","To ensure that no rewards are lost, the node cannot be unlinked unless the rewards have been claimed beforehand.","Claiming Rewards:","A user who owns a license and has set a node address calls claimRewards(...).","The function checks daily “epochs” (1 epoch = 24 hours, starting from a fixed startEpochTimestamp in 2025).","The user must provide an array of ComputeRewardsParams (one for each license they want to claim) plus arrays of signatures from oracles for each license.","The contract verifies that there are enough valid unique signers.","It calculates the number of tokens to mint. The maximum is determined by MAX_RELEASE_PER_DAY, which is derived from the fixed amount of R1 assigned per license divided by the 36-month (1080 epochs) mining period, multiplied by the node’s daily availability (0–255).","The contract mints the calculated R1 tokens to the caller, allowing the license to accumulate daily rewards if signed by the oracles.","Price Tiers:","ND licenses are sold in 12 ascending “price tiers,” each with a different USD cost and a fixed supply. Once a tier sells out, the contract automatically advances to the next tier.","Special “founder” licenses (max 500). They represent 26.1% of R1 total supply assigned across MND holders, plus a separate “genesis” license that corresponds to 28.9% of supply (total 55% if you include the GND’s portion plus MND’s portion, as outlined).","Key Differences from ND:","MND licenses are minted only by the owner of the contract (not purchased by users).","They are “soul-bound”, which means they are normally non transferable.","A transfer can only occur between two wallets belonging to the same entity (eg. for security reasons) if the contract owner calls initiateTransfer(...), specifying the new address. Similarly, a burn can only be executed if initiateBurn(...) is triggered. Otherwise _beforeTokenTransfer reverts the transaction.","The genesis license (ID = 1) is minted upon smart contract deployment and is assigned 28.9% of the total supply. Any rewards claimed with this license are minted directly to designated company wallets.","Other MND licenses (ID = 2..500) are allocated a portion of the total supply, with a combined maximum of 26.1%. No single license and no single wallet  can receive more than 2% of the total supply","There is a “no-mining” period of 223 epochs (223 days) after startEpochTimestamp for MND licenses. The genesis license can claim from day one.","After the no-mining period, the license can claim daily similarly to ND, using a “per-epoch availability.”","If it is the genesis token, the minted R1 tokens go directly to the set of company wallets (rather than the license holder). Otherwise, the amount of rewards will be determined with a sigmoid vesting formula and sent to the owner of the license.","Imagine a global network where each participant holds a digital title to a slice of “processing real estate.” Within this network, tokenized licenses let you harness compute power for a range of decentralized tasks - from training AI models to running IoT processing nodes, from hosting LLM-based services to maintaining efficient microservice endpoints. Everything unfolds in a trustless and secure environment, designed to incentivize ongoing operation and fair participation. The Ratio1 ecosystem brings this concept to life by combining a capped ERC20 token (R1) with two forms of ERC721 license contracts - one for general node operation (ND) and one for master or “founder” nodes (MND) - all orchestrated under carefully designed reward and liquidity mechanisms.","At the base of this system sits the R1 token, whose maximum supply is hard-coded into the token smart contract. It can only be minted or burned by the ND and MND contracts, preventing any unapproved expansion of the token supply. This property assures participants that the total token economy remains predictable. When someone decides to join the network as a node operator, they first engage with the NDContract, the home of Node Deeds. Each Deed is minted as an ERC721 license, purchased in predefined price tiers that are pegged to USD but ultimately paid in R1 tokens. The process relies on an external liquidity manager that quotes the token’s price, ensuring the correct conversion from R1 to USD and preventing surprise markups. Buyers deposit R1 tokens into the NDContract, which then divides the tokens among a burn address, for pool growth, and special “company wallets” that fuel the network’s ongoing development. A newly minted Deed license arrives in the buyer’s wallet, representing the right to claim future rewards by lending compute power to the network.","Once the license is in hand, the owner links it to an off-chain node address. The license confers the ability to provide computational services, handle daily availability reporting, and claim the resulting token rewards. Every 24 hours is considered an epoch, and over time, oracles confirm a node’s availability. The license owner submits these proofs (complete with valid signatures) to the NDContract. The contract then calculates how much R1 can be minted to the operator based on node performance. This direct relationship between real-world compute work and on-chain incentives helps turn a simple NFT license into a piece of true digital property that generates tokens in a fair and transparent way.","A parallel part of the ecosystem is the MNDContract for Master Node Deeds. Although it functions similarly in terms of claim logic and node linking, MND licenses differ in two ways: they are soul-bound and come with a special share of the total token supply. The soul-bound property means they cannot be moved or traded freely; the contract owner must specifically authorize any transfer, a design choice intended to keep these licenses in the hands of long-term supporters and founders that have an important role: maintain a strong and reliable network or oracle nodes that supervise the whole processing landscape. There is also a “genesis” license with its own core organization allocation of R1, used to fund the system’s core needs and ensure ongoing progress most notably the research and development grant funds and the social responsibility one.","Where ND licenses can be purchased by anyone willing to pay in R1, MND licenses are selectively assigned by the contract owner. The assigned amounts of R1 for each MND token are larger than an ordinary node license, providing a higher stake in the network’s operation. MND licenses also have a waiting period of 223 days before they can start claiming rewards, a feature that encourages stable, committed participation rather than speculative flipping. Both ND and MND node operators ultimately serve the same broad purpose: supplying reliable compute power so that training jobs, IoT processing, LLM-serving, and simple microservices can run without interruption and with verifiable performance.","All the on-chain components, specifically the smart contracts we’ve discussed, are designed with security as a top priority. Our approach ensures that no actor can alter the way the protocol functions, creating a Monolithic Smart Contract System between R1 Token, ND and MND SCs that is and inter-coupled.To ensure long-term reliability, we have invested significant effort in comprehensive testing, covering the protocol as a whole. With over 130 tests covering over 99% of the codebase, we have rigorously examined various scenarios, including potential attacks and unintentional misuses, to protect our protocol and our users as much as possible.","To further reinforce security and stability, we operate two additional networks alongside the mainnet: testnet and devnet. These environments allow us to simulate real-world scenarios with node communications and smart contract interactions. Testnet is a pre-production environment, mirroring mainnet 1:1, while devnet offers a faster-paced testing ground, featuring one-hour-long epochs for rapid iterations.","One aspect that smart contracts cannot directly verify on-chain is node availability - a critical factor in determining rewards. Since rewards must only be distributed to active node operators, this component required a robust solution. Our oracle system ensures a secure and decentralized approach to tracking node activity.","Each contract maintains a whitelist of authorized signers, consisting of EVM addresses controlled by trusted entities - founders, team members, and partners. These oracles continuously monitor the network, listen for node heartbeats, and reach consensus on each node’s actual availability during a given epoch. Without their validated signatures, no license - not even the GND - can mint rewards if its associated node was inactive.","To further strengthen security, the system allows for an adjustable minimumRequiredSignatures threshold. This ensures that multiple nodes must sign the verification message before the smart contract mints any rewards, reinforcing trust in the network and guaranteeing that only genuine uptime is rewarded.","Our ecosystem is built on a seamless interaction between multiple smart contracts, which work together while integrating data from oracles to accurately calculate rewards.","Beyond the on-chain mechanics, full compliance is one of our core values. To ensure regulatory alignment, every license sale requires KYC/KYB verification for clients, along with an invoice issuance upon purchase. This process is managed through a distributed microservice running on our oracles, which securely stores data provided by our compliance partner. For every buy transaction, a signed message is generated to verify that the buyer has successfully passed the compliance checks.","Moreover, our storage and event systems act as a monitoring layer, enabling seamless integration with other components. For instance:","When a user purchases a license, an event is emitted, which the microservice automatically detects, triggering invoice generation for the buyer.","The signerSignaturesCount storage allows us to track oracle signatures, ensuring that all oracles contribute equally and detecting potential abuse or discrepancies in the system.","Another fundamental pillar of our ecosystem is the direct connection between our smart contracts and dAuth, enabling two key integrations:","Node activation control – A node cannot be started unless it is linked to a valid license, ensuring that only committed participants can join the network.","Oracle node promotion – Any node added to the signers whitelist is automatically promoted as an oracle by dAuth, streamlining and securing this critical role.","These integrations provide flexibility for interacting with our diverse components while maintaining long-term adaptability. This approach ensures that we can easily support future innovations, such as the integration of the Proof of AI Contract.","The reward mechanisms in these contracts revolve around signatures from trusted oracles, multi-sig logic, and meticulous math to ensure no operator claims more than their fair share. Each day’s potential rewards are strictly capped. The total minted to all node operators can never exceed the pre-defined fractions of the overall R1 supply, which keeps the economic system balanced. Admins hold certain powers to add or remove oracle signers, update company wallet addresses, and ban licenses that break protocol rules, reflecting a cautious approach to security as the ecosystem matures.","By combining an ERC20 token with a carefully measured mint-and-burn design, distributing node licenses as ERC721 tokens in ascending price tiers, and tying license ownership to real compute work, the Ratio1 ecosystem reimagines the concept of “decentralized processing real estate”. Each license becomes a direct claim on future token emissions, but only if the holder actually operates and maintains the underlying node. In this way, holders are rewarded for honest work and stable uptime, building a trustless but fair system in which no single party can unilaterally mint excessive tokens or manipulate supply at will. The end result is a network that welcomes people to acquire a Node Deed, connect their compute-infrastructure, and then reliably serve tasks, from small IoT workloads to demanding AI model training. The entire architecture provides a transparent, incentive-aligned environment where participants and the network as a whole benefit from the steady contribution of processing power.","Next episode we go beyond our Proof-of-Availability and will be on our Proof-of-AI user-experience - true democratization of job distribution where participants (from low level 2 core, 8 GiB VMs to gaming workstations to high end A100-powered machines) are incentivized proportionally to their contributions.","Alessandro De Franceschi","Feb 28, 2025","‹ Exploring the Next Frontier with Ratio1 meta-OS, Decentralized MLOps, and CSCS25","Introducing R1FS.

Instead of hosting your bot on a single centralized server, you leverage a global network of Edge Nodes. This eliminates single points of failure and ensures your bot remains resilient.","Bots should and can scale horizontally across multiple Edge Nodes, and data is managed securely using cryptographic keys. This approach is especially appealing if you expect a surge in traffic or require strong data ownership guarantees - important for both developers and investors.","Forget about spinning up separate VMs or messing with complex DevOps pipelines. With Ratio1, you define your logic, deploy  and “ze zee zeet”. The integrated system automatically takes care of containerization, horizontal scaling, self-healing, routing, authentication… you name it.","TL;DR: You own the data, you own the code, costs and deployment. Your system. Secured by immutable Blockchain.","Running Edge NodeYou’ll need a Ratio1 Edge Node up and running. For testing, this can be on your local machine or a remote server. You can find instructions in our other tutorials on how to spin up a node with Docker so please refer to our specific posts and tutorials for more details on how to spin up a Ratio1 Edge Node both for the free faucet-based Testnet as well as for the Mainnet where on-chain (Base L2) Node Deed licensing is required.","Python & Ratio1 SDKEnsure you have Python 3+ installed along with the Ratio1 SDK.","Note2: You’ll propably want to test your code on the Ratio1 testnet so make sure you switch via the r1ctl CLI tool to the correct network with:","Telegram Bot TokenGenerate a Bot Token using @BotFather BotFather on Telegram.","You’ll insert this token into the code shortly via an in-code variable or an environment variable.","Note: Always make sure your SDK is paired with your node","After updating your SDK via","Just run a simple configuration checking using","And you will receive something like","The you just copy the 0xai internal address and give it to your node via the container add_allowed command:","Where certainly the 0xai_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is the address copied from your r1ctl config show client command.  As we result you should obtain something similar with this output below where you can clearly see in the allowed addresses whitelist your client address. If this command fails then it means your node is not running or it is running under other docker container name than r1node (only if you make custom special installs)","Note: running the docker exec r1node add_allowed or the docker exec r1node get_node_info commands will show a list of several (quite a few actually) nodes that are allowed on your node by default - these are the oracles that supervise your node and make sure you get your Proof-of-Availability rewards as well as your Proof-of-AI rewards for the specific jobs you receive.","Below is a basic Echo Bot designed to reply to user messages with a playful twist - tracking each user’s message count.","Note: take care of either providing the EE_TARGET_NODE and EE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN via the environment or directly in code as suggested. If you want to provide them in environment you can store your keys in the ~/.ratio1/config file.","reply(plugin, message, user): Your custom callback function that defines how the bot responds.","plugin.int_cache[user]: A plugin system built-in integer cache for persisting data between user messages. Sufficient for counting messages, storing small preferences, etc.","session = Session(): This will kick-off your session including any special environment variables you defined in your ~/.ratio1/config file, connect to the designated network (testnet, mainnet and devnet when available) and other basic connection stuff.","session.create_telegram_simple_bot(...): This makes it easy to bring up a Telegram bot pipeline with a single method call, passing in your Telegram token.","Once you run python echo.py, your Echo Bot will be online, echoing messages from any user who starts a conversation with it on Telegram.","Want to create something more interactive? Blackjack Bot showcases how to handle game logic (e.g., deck states, user hand values) within Ratio1’s decentralized environment. Once again provide the EE_TARGET_NODE and EE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN via the environment or directly in code as suggested.","Stateful ExperienceThe plugin.obj_cache[user] dictionary lets you store more complex objects - like card hands and win/loss counts - between messages. Through the plugin object, you can access the whole plethora of business processing templates, advanced data management, and even shallow machine learning features Ratio1 offers (as the Deep Learning models are served by a different layer that feeds the data to the business plugins layer).","Card Logic & Deck ManagementDemonstrates how you can integrate real-time calculations (like adjusting Ace from 11 to 1) without losing state across multiple user interactions.","Zero DevOps OverheadYou focus on the game logic; Ratio1 handles the decentralized environment, ensuring high availability and security.","IMPORTANT: In this second example we leave the pipeline (the application) running on the target node. We can close the pipeline with a simple session.close_pipeline(my_node, my_pipeline) like in below example:","Ratio1 leverages a concept of pipelines for running services, and plugins to house both pre-made templates as well as your custom code. When you call create_telegram_simple_bot, you’re effectively spinning up a new pipeline with the embedded plugin instance for Telegram bot with all required dependencies (i.e. a Telegram interface plus your callback function).","Your bot lives on a selected Edge Node, which acts as the compute layer. Because it’s decentralized, you can choose one or multiple nodes across different geographical regions - or even in your own data center. In our case we deploy on the local node. Note that the SDK connects to the local node as on any other node no matter the location/distance.","Ratio1’s dAuth system ensures that any pipeline or plugin creation and deployment process is authenticated trustlessly. No single authority has ultimate control over your data, which is especially appealing to investors and teams that prioritize data sovereignty. Data democracy is the name of the game!","Community Engagement: Quickly set up fun or utility bots - like polls, games, or daily tips - directly in Telegram without the usual infrastructure overhead.","Customer Service: Offer decentralized support channels that can automatically handle load balancing, ensuring consistent performance.","Gamification & Loyalty: Build on-chain reward systems or tournaments that store player progress and results across multiple channels.","Deploying Telegram bots on Ratio1 is a powerful, streamlined experience that merges decentralized infrastructure, robust security, and minimal overhead. Whether you’re spinning up a simple Echo Bot or a stateful Blackjack Bot, Ratio1’s plugin system ensures your code can scale - and remain fault-tolerant - across a global network of Edge Nodes.","Ready to take it further?","Integrate advanced AI or GPT-based models to handle more nuanced conversation flows or specialized tasks.","Connect your bot to external APIs, payment systems, or on-chain data.","Explore multiple node deployments for enhanced redundancy and performance.","Ratio1 opens the door to a new era of bot deployment where data ownership, security, and ease-of-use are front and center.

Unlike isolated GPT-style tools, J33VES provides end-to-end support - from pinpointing bugs to generating production-ready code - by leveraging a secure, private knowledge base of your project. This next-level AI integration not only multiplies developer productivity but also extends to other domains (legal, finance, security) where deep, domain-wide context is crucial.","Imagine having a brilliant software team at your fingertips - an AI that knows your entire codebase and can instantly help design, debug, or build any module. Today’s coding assistants (like GPT-based tools) offer a glimpse of this power, but they operate in isolation. Developers feed them small snippets or single files, getting useful suggestions in return, yet the broader context is always missing. The result? You can debug or generate pieces of code, but you can’t easily develop a complex enterprise application end-to-end with AI - at least not with current off-the-shelf agents. This is the limitation Ratio1’s J33VES is poised to overcome, heralding a bold new era of AI-assisted work for developers and beyond.","Despite the hype around AI pair programmers, most teams today use them in a very fragmented way. Each developer might craft their own prompts and send a piece of code or pseudo-code to a GPT model for help. The AI might suggest a bug fix, review a function, or even rewrite a module. But it’s always working blind to the rest of the project. It doesn’t see the entire codebase - the thousands of interdependent files and business-specific logic - so its answers, however clever, are narrowly focused.","This “narrow focus” means you can use GPT-4 to build a toy app or a demo, especially if it’s based on something popular that the model already knows (say, a little to-do list app or a Blackjack bot on Telegram). But ask it to contribute to a large, production codebase with dozens of microservices or a proprietary framework, and it struggles. Without understanding the whole system, an off-the-shelf AI can’t ensure an addition fits cleanly into your architecture. It might not know about that custom Utilities module your team wrote last year, or the subtle differences between your internal APIs. In short, current AI coding tools operate like isolated geniuses - capable of brilliance in a vacuum, but not great team players.","Major tech companies recognized this limitation early and took a different approach: give the AI access to everything. Instead of treating the AI as a code snippet oracle, they treat it as a team member with a photographic memory of the entire codebase. How? By creating private knowledge bases from their source code repositories, converting all modules into vector embeddings (via code summarization models) that an AI can query. In other words, these companies built their own internal “JEEVES”-like assistants that truly understand their code.","For example, Sourcegraph’s Cody assistant is designed to read an organization’s entire repository and code graph, providing answers or code suggestions with full context. In such a system, a developer can ask, “How do we validate user payments?” and the AI will know which modules and functions relate to payments, pulling in the relevant code and documentation to answer. The interaction with an AI like this looks less like one-off prompting and more like working with a knowledgeable colleague across the whole project:","Problem Presented: The developer describes an issue or feature request. (e.g., “Users can’t reset their password via the mobile app. Investigate and fix this bug.”)","Context Assembled: The AI agent automatically scans the codebase embeddings to find all relevant files - perhaps the password reset module, the mobile API controller, and the database schema for user accounts.","Intelligent Prompting: Using those findings, the system composes a detailed query for the LLM, including code snippets or summaries from those modules (this is done heuristically, e.g. “Here are the related functions X, Y, Z and their content…”).","AI Solution Draft: The LLM processes this comprehensive input and generates an output - maybe it identifies a logic error in how token expiration is handled, and suggests code changes. Importantly, it also gives a confidence score or indication of whether it’s unsure or if further checks are needed.","Iterate if Needed: If the AI isn’t confident or flags new sub-problems (“I fixed the reset bug, but noticed the email module might not be sending the link correctly”), the system loops back. It pulls more context (e.g., the email module code) and feeds it in, letting the AI refine its answer. Steps 2-4 repeat, automatically, until the AI is reasonably confident it has a correct and complete solution.","Deliver Solution: The final result is presented as integrated, ready-to-use code - spanning all the necessary parts of the codebase - which the developer can then review and merge.","This kind of codebase-aware AI workflow is what enables tech giants to use AI beyond trivial examples. It’s how they can attempt building real features with AI’s help, because the AI isn’t flying blind - it has the company’s entire software knowledge at hand. Until recently, this level of AI integration was locked behind closed doors at Fortune 500 firms. But Ratio1 is changing that.","In today’s rapidly expanding AI ecosystem, several tools aim to assist developers in various capacities. GitHub Copilot Workspace extends beyond inline code suggestions, providing a space where developers can iterate on snippets, get syntax corrections, and brainstorm with an AI partner. It’s known for speeding up common coding tasks within the GitHub universe and tightly integrates with widely used editors like VS Code.","Cursor and Windsurf are newer entrants that focus on streamlining developer workflows with AI-driven code completion and refactoring. Cursor, for instance, tries to simplify the coding process by allowing developers to “chat” with their code directly in the editor. Windsurf focuses on real-time collaboration features, allowing multiple developers to share an AI-assisted environment that tracks changes and offers context-specific suggestions.","Meanwhile, Sourcegraph’s Cody, as mentioned, aims to be a repository-wide knowledge engine, letting users query entire codebases for definitions, references, or recommended changes. Each of these solutions offers valuable assistance for general coding scenarios and can definitely boost efficiency on smaller or more generic projects.","Ratio1 J33VES is our answer to those private “super-assistants” - a platform that gives any development team the same kind of AI firepower that big companies enjoy. In essence, J33VES = LLM + embeddings + R1FS (Ratio1 File System). It’s a decentralized, private knowledge base of everything in your code repository, combined with powerful AI agents that leverage that knowledge. We sometimes call J33VES a “simulator” of entire teams of professionals, because it can effectively take on the roles of multiple team members:","Software engineers: with access to all source code, it can act as a senior developer or an entire dev team, writing and refactoring code across modules.","QA testers: by analyzing code context, it can anticipate integration issues or edge cases a tester might catch.","Project architects: it understands high-level structure and can ensure new code aligns with the overall design and patterns of the system.","And not just tech roles - imagine it loaded with your company’s legal contracts or financial data, ready to assist a lawyer or accountant with equal proficiency.","Crucially, J33VES is built on decentralized and privacy-first principles. Your code’s embeddings are stored on R1FS - a secure distributed file system - ensuring that sensitive source code never leaves your environment. You can have an arbitrary number of tenants (end users or teams), each with practically unlimited amounts of source code indexed. Each tenant can even plug in different AI models of their choice. This means whether you’re a lone developer, a startup, or a huge enterprise, J33VES scales to your needs. It’s not a one-size-fits-all demo on a sample project - it’s your entire codebase, on demand.","What does it feel like to work with J33VES? It’s like entering a dialogue with your codebase itself. The AI can answer questions about any part of the system, point you to exactly where a bug is likely originating, or generate new code that fits seamlessly with the old code. And it doesn’t stop at just writing code; it maintains a conversation until the problem is truly solved. In other words, J33VES doesn’t just spit out a code snippet and call it a day - it works with you until it knows the solution is solid.","Most of today’s popular AI coding assistants - like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and Cody - are designed as generalists. They excel at providing generic boilerplate or helping you write code when you can chunk the problem into smaller bites. But when you’re dealing with a proprietary, evolving, or highly specialized codebase, these tools can’t reliably see the full picture of your project. Moreover, they’re not deeply aligned with a specific ecosystem or platform, which means their expertise is wide but only surface-level for any given framework.","By contrast, J33VES is laser-focused on the Ratio1 SDK/API and overall development framework, ensuring that it’s intimately familiar with the nuances, modules, and best practices that drive Ratio1-based projects. It’s akin to having a specialized engineer on your team who not only brings top-tier coding foundations but also has deep, domain-specific knowledge of the exact tools and libraries you use day to day.","Additionally, the future is pointing toward a multi-agent ecosystem, where each AI agent is specialized in a manner similar to a highly skilled programmer with a specific niche - front-end frameworks, backend infrastructure, database optimization, etc. J33VES fits neatly into this vision, acting as the specialized agent for Ratio1-centered development while seamlessly integrating with other domain-specific AI agents when needed.","We’ve heard the anxious question: “Will AI replace developers?” The truth is, developers who embrace AI like J33VES will replace those who don’t. This is a classic technological shift - those who adapt gain a massive edge. J33VES allows a single developer to produce correct, production-ready code 2–4× faster than before. This isn’t a vague promise; it’s a reality we’ve observed. (Even conservative studies by McKinsey have found developers can complete tasks up to twice as fast with today’s generative AI. With a tool as advanced as J33VES, the gains are even greater.) By automating the boilerplate and grunt work, it elevates developers to focus on higher-level problems. In effect, it’s as if every developer on your team can operate at the level of an architect or team lead, because they have an AI expert backing them up on all the details.","Let’s break down the key impacts:","Speed and Efficiency: J33VES dramatically cuts the time needed for coding, debugging, and code reviews. Tasks that used to take a week might be done in a day or two. Routine work (like wiring up yet another CRUD microservice or writing repetitive unit tests) can be handled in minutes. You spend less time searching through code or StackOverflow and more time actually building.","Quality and Consistency: Because the AI always considers the whole codebase, the code it produces or suggests tends to be more consistent with your existing patterns. It catches integration issues early (for example, if your new module doesn’t handle a case that some other module would trigger, J33VES might flag it). Fewer bugs escape into production.","Empowerment of All Skill Levels: Junior developers suddenly have a safety net and a mentor available 24/7. They can ask J33VES “How do I implement this feature?” and get guidance that not only gives them code but also explains which existing code to reuse. For senior engineers, it’s like having an army of diligent assistants, freeing them to tackle the really challenging design decisions.","End-to-End Development: You’re not just getting help on a snippet - you can feasibly build whole features with J33VES. From designing the database schema, to writing the backend logic, to even drafting API documentation, the AI can contribute at each step with full context. This means products get to market faster and developers spend more time on creative design rather than plumbing and wiring.","In practical terms, Ratio1 provides more than just the J33VES agent. The platform is centered on utility and developer experience. Common boilerplate is either pre-templatized or auto-generated by J33VES on the fly. This removes the dull parts of coding from your to-do list. Instead of writing yet another data model class or service interface, you can let the AI handle it and concentrate on how the pieces should fit together. Your role shifts towards being the strategist and architect - the one who decides what needs to be built and why - while J33VES helps figure out how. This is how developers remain highly relevant in the age of AI: by leveraging the AI to amplify their output and expanding their scope.","There really is no alternative if you want to stay at the cutting edge. Those who refuse to adapt - who insist on only hand-coding everything as they did before - risk becoming obsolete in the face of teams that use AI and move much faster. It’s harsh but true: a developer not using AI will be outpaced (and likely out of a job) when competing with an AI-augmented developer producing results four times faster with fewer errors. The same goes for many professions.","Although we’ve focused on software development, this paradigm shift isn’t confined to code. J33VES is a concept that extends to any knowledge work. The idea of an AI “team simulator” can apply to lawyers (an AI that has read all case law and your entire brief, ready to draft arguments or find precedents), to teachers (an AI that knows every curriculum standard and all your past lesson plans, helping you craft personalized materials), to accountants and financial auditors (an AI that has ingested all transaction records and regulations, auditing in real-time), and to security analysts (an AI that’s read all system logs and threat intel, always on the lookout for anomalies). The list goes on - content creators, architects, researchers - essentially anyone who works with large bodies of information.","The reason it matters for a wide audience is that AI with full-context understanding will redefine how we all work. Ratio1’s platform happens to start with code, but its core principle is utility for any complex task. If you equip professionals with AI that holds their organization’s entire knowledge base, you give them a superpower. The lawyer with this AI can outperform those without it; the teacher can provide more tailored education; the security auditor can catch issues that others miss. In every field, those who pair their human expertise with AI that leverages full context will leap ahead of those who don’t. It’s a tidal wave of change coming to all industries.","We stand at the brink of a new era where working side by side with AI is the norm. Ratio1’s J33VES is not science fiction or a distant promise - it’s here to bridge the gap between what AI can do in theory and what you can achieve in practice today. By integrating large language models with your entire knowledge base, J33VES transforms AI from a fancy code assistant for toy problems into a game-changing partner for real-world projects.","For developers, this means the ability to design and deliver software faster, with confidence and clarity, while continuously learning and focusing on the bigger picture. For organizations, it means unprecedented scalability of talent - your teams can do more with less, and even small startups can access “enterprise-level” development capabilities. And for everyone, it marks the path to remaining relevant in an AI-driven world: become the architect of solutions, and let AI handle the heavy lifting of implementation details.","The paradigm shift is clear. Just as electricity or the internet transformed jobs in the last century, AI-powered code intelligence (and knowledge intelligence broadly) will transform work in this one. The question to ask yourself isn’t “Will AI make me redundant?” but rather “How can I harness this to expand my own capabilities?” Those who answer that question by embracing tools like J33VES will find that the future isn’t something to fear - it’s something they’re actively building, faster and better than ever before.","Petrica Butusina","Apr 9, 2025","‹ Ratio1: The AI System That Puts You in Control","Exploring the Next Frontier with Ratio1 meta-OS, Decentralized MLOps, and CSCS25 ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

This approach drastically reduces data transfer overhead and allows real-time, large-scale computations across a network of peers.","Community-driven EDS: Allow multiple researchers or analysts to concurrently publish their local findings (e.g., aggregated summaries or visualizations) to R1FS. Everyone benefits from insights without needing direct, bulk data transfers, boosting collaborative insights in crowdsourced analytics.","Multi-institution collaboration: Different labs or companies (even cross-disciplinary) can securely share configurations, data subsets, or progress updates. The R1FS + ChainStorage duo helps maintain a mutualized view of ongoing work, while each participant retains full control of their proprietary information.","Collaborative data collectionDeploy on multiple IoT devices or analytics nodes - each sending local stats into R1FS and announcing them. Every node sees everyone else’s data in near real-time.","Decentralized document exchangeNeed to exchange large files or critical documents? Store them in R1FS and have your network retrieve them directly from whichever node has them - no single point of failure.","Cross-node configurationShare configuration or state files across distributed systems. One node’s update automatically becomes available to all others, ensuring frictionless synchronization.","The R1fsDemoPlugin is a demonstration plugin designed to:","Generate random data and store it in R1FS, Ratio1's private, IPFS-like storage system.","Publish the resulting CID (Content Identifier) of that data to the Ratio1 ChainStore (hash-set), allowing all participating peers to discover it.","Periodically watch for new CIDs published by other peers, retrieve the corresponding files, and process them (in our example, a simple YAML dump).","In short, it’s a straightforward illustration of how to broadcast data - be it YAML-based or any other type of file - to a distributed network where everyone can find and download it. Whether you’re spinning up one node or an entire swarm, R1fsDemoPlugin ensures that all participants can both announce and consume each other’s shared data in near real-time.","When you want to share data:","Randomized Info: The plugin generates a UUID plus a random integer.","Serialization: That info is serialized to YAML.","Commit to R1FS: Using r1fs.add_yaml(), it’s stored in R1FS - instantly returning a CID to reference the newly added content.","cid = self.r1fs.add_yaml(data)","Note: R1FS supports various formats and methods ranging from basic add_file(), get_file() to  add_json(), add_pickle(), etc. For the demo, we’re using YAML for clarity, but the concept is identical for other data formats.","Once a piece of data is safely tucked away in R1FS, its CID is announced to the network:","hkey='r1fs-demo' functions like a namespace for the key-value store (just like a hash set).","key=self.my_id is the plugin’s unique identifier (we often use the node alias or instance ID).","value=cid is the pointer to the actual data stored in R1FS.","Now, any peer can run chainstore_hgetall('r1fs-demo') to fetch all announced CIDs, including the one just published.","Periodically, the plugin checks for CIDs announced by others via dct_data = self.chainstore_hgetall('r1fs-demo')","It then filters out its own announcements (to avoid re-fetching the data it just created) and retrieves the files using fn = self.r1fs.get_file(cid)","If the file is YAML, the plugin dumps the content to the logs (or does something more interesting in a real-world scenario). R1FS handles the underlying peer-to-peer content exchange, ensuring the file is fetched from whichever node advertises it.","Every 30 seconds (or however it’s configured), the process() method is called. It does two critical things:","share_local_data(): Checks if it’s been an hour since the last data share. If so, it creates new random data, stores it in R1FS, and publishes the CID via the ChainStore.","show_remote_shared_data():Looks up new CIDs published by other peers, retrieves them, and logs the data for visibility.","This ensures that every node in the system gently trickles out new data and picks up fresh content from others, making the entire network’s data flow both fluid and robust.","Below is an example pipeline (think of it as a Ratio1 “app”) that directs each node to run this plugin. With just one step - launch the pipeline on at least two nodes - you’re already set to see data seamlessly shared across nodes.","Simply load this pipeline on any two (or more!) Ratio1 nodes to start the R1fsDemoPlugin on each. Once running, the plugin will take care of storing random data, announcing the CID, and discovering what others share. You can also programmatically launch a pipeline using Python code.Note: Always make sure your SDK is paired with your node","After updating your SDK via","Just run a simple configuration checking using","And you will receive something like","Then you just copy the 0xai internal address and give it to your node via the container add_allowed command:","Where certainly the 0xai_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is the address copied from your r1ctl config show client command.  As we result you should obtain something similar with this output below where you can clearly see in the allowed addresses whitelist your client address. If this command fails then it means your node is not running or it is running under other docker container name than r1node (only if you make custom special installs)","Note: running the docker exec r1node add_allowed or the docker exec r1node get_node_info commands will show a list of several (quite a few actually) nodes that are allowed on your node by default - these are the oracles that supervise your node and make sure you get your Proof-of-Availability rewards as well as your Proof-of-AI rewards for the specific jobs you receive.","For this tutorial, make sure you have allowed the SDK and the Edge Nodes to communicate. Follow the allowance scheme below.","After a short wait, you’ll see the plugin logs start streaming details about new data being stored and discovered. It’s a trivial example that packs a big punch in demonstrating decentralized workflows.","The R1fsDemoPlugin perfectly showcases how R1FS and ChainStorage can unify to create a frictionless, fully decentralized data-sharing environment. Whether you’re dealing with simple YAML blobs or entire directories, the principle remains the same:","Store your content in a swarm-based file system.","Broadcast its location in a distributed key-value store.","Synchronize among peers - everyone picks up what they need, when they need it.","Give it a spin, watch the logs, and see how elegantly your nodes learn about and acquire each other’s data. As you gain confidence, you’ll find it easy to layer more complex features like tokens, advanced access rules, or concurrency on top of the same basic approach.","Ready to try it yourself? Load the plugin, tweak the data-sharing interval, or store custom data - then sit back and let R1FS and ChainStorage do their magic.","Below is the complete code for the R1fsDemoPlugin. Feel free to copy and adapt it in your Ratio1 deployment. n","Note: Please be aware that this plugin code is already bundled within the Ratio1 Edge Nodes as a “template” plugin so you do not need to execute, try or do anything with it. The plugin itself cannot and will not run outside the Edge Node ecosystem/environment.","That’s it! The R1fsDemoPlugin provides a neat, self-contained example of the decentralized power offered by Ratio1’s ecosystem. Happy experimenting - and welcome to the future of peer-to-peer data sharing.","Andrei Ionut Damian","Feb 21, 2025","‹ The Ratio1 Smart Contracts Ecosystem","Deploying Telegram bots on Ratio1: from naive Echo-bot to a serious Blackjack-dealer ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

Kaizen and pomodoro are two powerful methodologies that, at their core, enable steady, incremental gains and champion true innovation. So, they reward you for iterating, adjusting, and ultimately never settling for \"just good enough.\"","Yet, all too often, I’ve seen these powerful methodologies get co-opted (and twisted) by various mindsets such as trying to make 9 women give birth to a child in 1 month because \"it’s taking forever\", \"dislike\"-ing products, dismissing a complex initiative for \"sucking the energy\" and seeing life-long learning as a burden... The real culprit? I guess bad habits and diluted philosophies that equate \"finishing quickly\" with \"finishing well.\" We’ve all heard the excuses but the truth is, bad habits and misguided beliefs spread like viruses, undermining genuine creativity and meaningful product evolution but enough of that!","At Ratio1, we’re committed to flipping the script and \"never settling\" isn't just yet another buzzword. We’re not here to cram. We’re here to innovate, continuously refactor, and simplify. It’s truly a journey and we're committed to continuous refactoring, relentless simplification, and incremental innovation - punctuated by the occasional dramatic leap - because real progress demands a willingness to reimagine, recalibrate, and then push forward again.","Always with an eye on the bigger prize, recently we overhauled our Edge Node onboarding and user experience, making it even more seamless for command-line enthusiasts and UI lovers alike.

Tweak the container names and volumes to avoid conflicts:","While docker-compose support is available for running multiple Ratio1 Edge Nodes on the same machine, this setup is not recommended and not officially supported. There are important caveats to be aware of before using this approach:","Running multiple Edge Nodes via docker-compose on a single physical machine without virtualization can lead to protocol-level job assignment issues. The Ratio1 protocol treats each node as an independent unit, but when nodes share the same hardware, this can cause the following:","The job distribution algorithm (e.g., round-robin) will see all co-located nodes as equally eligible for work.","All nodes may receive the same job, resulting in redundant processing across multiple containers.","Despite this shared workload, only one node will be paid for successfully completing the job.","This leads to wasted compute resources, artificially diluted job statistics, and no increase in actual reward output.","If you need to run multiple nodes on the same physical host, we strongly recommend using virtual machines (VMs) to isolate each node.

That’s the idea behind Ratio1, which its creators call an “AI operating system powered by blockchain” .  In plain terms, Ratio1 connects many everyday devices - laptops, PCs or even cloud servers - into a decentralized supercomputer for AI .  Anyone with a spare computer can join: your device becomes an edge node in a global network, doing pieces of AI work.  Think of it like “compute ride-sharing”: just as Uber turned car rides into a shared service, Ratio1 lets you share spare computing power and get paid for it .  By pooling these resources, small businesses and individuals can launch AI services without owning big data centers.","Imagine it as an AI energy grid or Uber network for computation.  Lots of individual computers (the nodes) stand ready like drivers or power generators.  When someone needs an AI task done, the work is split into pieces and sent out to these nodes.  Each node processes its piece and sends back results.  The system’s blockchain keeps secure track of who did what and pays them in R1 tokens.  This happens behind the scenes: you don’t need to know blockchain or networking to participate.","Becoming a Ratio1 node operator (running one node or even a fleet of nodes) is designed to be frictionless, even for non-technical users .  You don’t need to write code or handle complicated security keys or perform complex installations procedures.  Thanks to tools like dAuth, the Edge Node Launcher or r1setup, onboarding is mostly click-and-run or a wizard-guided-experience.  Node operators can “spin up a Node and monetize [their] hardware without tedious onboarding steps” .  Even novices enjoy a “frictionless” experience - no manual setup of passwords or ports is required.","One of the great advantages of Ratio1 is flexibility on multiple levels.  You can run a node on local hardware (your home or office computer) using the Ratio1 Launcher or on a rented server (a cloud VPS). Learn more about how to run an Edge Node on your local PC: Link 1 and Link 2. To set up a whole fleet of nodes using r1setup, see this link.","To become a node operator, you first need to purchase a Node Deed (ND)  license via the Ratio1 dApp at https://app.ratio1.ai. These are available to the public and serve as your entry ticket to the Ratio1 network. With over 46,000 Node Deeds available, each allocated an equal slice of the 45% of the total R1 token supply as PoA mining, there are ample opportunities for participation. See link for the how to of buying a license.","Importantly, the network rewards nodes in two ways (called Proof of Availability mining and Proof of AI and rewards distribution).  Proof-of-Availability means you earn simply by keeping your node online and available and thus the node participates automatically in various network services with minimal load.  Proof-of-AI means you earn extra when your node actually completes AI, IoT or other work for various consumers.  This dual model ensures honest participation and fair rewards.  In practice, it means the longer and harder your machine works for the network, the more you make - much like earning more on Uber the more trips you drive.","Beyond direct benefits","Running a Ratio1 node also means supporting a more sustainable AI ecosystem.  Instead of massive, power-hungry data centers, the network reuses idle machines worldwide.  This not only puts your hardware to productive use, it can reduce overall carbon footprint by maximizing existing resources.  And since the protocol is decentralized, there’s no single company controlling it - it’s truly “AI powered by you”. In effect, every participant helps democratize AI while earning compensation.","The Ratio1 protocol represents a fundamental shift toward democratized AI computing and towards “Your AI, your Data”. By eliminating technical barriers and providing clear economic incentives, it enables anyone to participate in the AI revolution while building a more sustainable and distributed computing infrastructure. Whether you're looking for passive income through a single node or building a scalable AI services business, Ratio1 provides the tools and opportunities to succeed in the decentralized AI economy.","Andrei Ionut Damian","Jun 11, 2025","‹ Transparency as a Principle, Not a Slogan - And Why We're Sharing Our Foundation Wallets","From Zero to Node Runner [Mainnet] ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

Containerization is a way to package software so it works the same everywhere. Imagine a container like a little box that holds your app, plus everything it needs to run - its code, tools, and settings. No matter where you run the box - on your laptop, in the cloud, or on another computer - it behaves the same. It’s like putting your app in a lunchbox so it doesn’t get mixed up with anything else. This helps avoid the common “it worked on my machine” problem, makes apps start faster, and saves space compared to older methods like virtual machines.","What is orchestration? Orchestration is the process of automatically managing how software containers are deployed, started, stopped, updated, and scaled across multiple machines. Think of it like a conductor leading an orchestra - making sure each container (or “instrument”) plays its part at the right time and in harmony with the others. In large applications, there could be dozens or hundreds of containers that need to work together. Orchestration tools like Kubernetes handle the behind-the-scenes complexity, deciding where containers should run, restarting them if they fail, and scaling them up or down based on demand. It ensures your apps stay available, efficient, and easy to manage - even at large scale.Container orchestration is vital in cloud-native apps – tools like Kubernetes have become the “de-facto standard” for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containers. However, traditional orchestrators assume a centrally managed cluster. Ratio1 reimagines this by running orchestration on a decentralized, trustless compute fabric. In Ratio1’s network, any device (server, laptop, edge gateway) can run a “Edge Node” agent that contributes CPU/GPU resources. These Edge Nodes form a peer-to-peer cluster with no single point of control. Smart contracts and on-chain oracles govern task distribution, payments, and security, so applications (AI models or containerized services) can be deployed across pooled, non-custodial compute without requiring users to trust any single operator. In effect, Ratio1 Deeploy serves as the managed API gateway for container/AI workloads: you submit a request to Deeploy, and it securely provisions that container across the Ratio1 Edge Node network.","Decentralized orchestration solves challenges unique to edge/IoT environments. In a distributed edge network there is no central authority and devices can dynamically join or leave. Edge nodes are highly heterogeneous (CPU types, GPUs, memory), and payments or incentives must flow peer-to-peer. Ratio1 Deeploy’s design reflects these realities: it leverages blockchain-based identity and consensus so that no one has to trust a central scheduler, yet each job is verified and routed correctly. This model improves scalability and resilience: as more nodes join, the mesh grows; there is no single failure point, and idle hardware is utilized efficiently. By automating network-wide workload placement and using token‑based incentives, Ratio1 aims to “turn everyday devices into AI servers” and drastically cut AI cloud costs.","Decentralized orchestration through Ratio1 oracle network across multiple nodes eliminates reliance on traditional central orchestrator. This in turn makes the ecosystem dramatically more robust to attacks, outages or other disruptive events, as the failure one ore more controller nodes will not hinder the orchestration process. Concurrently the workers across the ecosystem are formed from a totally heterogeneous infrastructure rather than being limited to a quasi-homogeneous resources. Finally, we have to emphasise that this fully aligns with the anti-censorship and own-your-data Ratio1 policy.","Before diving into the full Deeploy flow, it helps to see a basic hands-on example. The Ratio1 Python SDK lets you target a single pre-authorized node and deploy a container there. For instance, a toy demo ex18_deploy_container_webapi.py does the following:","Initialize a Session. The script starts by creating a ratio1.Session, which sets up trustless authentication to the Ratio1 network (via dAuth).","Specify the Edge Node. You point the SDK to an Edge Node address (in a dev network this node is already “whitelisted” to accept requests).","Create a Container App. Using a method like session.create_container_app (or similar), the script packages a Docker image or command. For example, it might spin up a simple HTTP server inside a Python container.","Deploy to the Node. Calling app.deploy() sends the container to the node. The node then launches the containerized web API and returns a public URL.","Wait/Monitor (optional). The script can pause and monitor logs or results. It then prints out something like “Web API deployed at: http://” so you can test the service.","This low-level script bypasses the full Deeploy machinery (no on-chain escrow, no multi-node routing, no blockchain authentication, no managed orchestration ). It’s not production-grade, but it’s ideal for learning and prototyping. It shows how the Ratio1 SDK automatically handles container packaging and node communication. In practice, you’d use this in a dev setting or experimentation phase. Once you’re ready to scale or secure the deployment, you would move to the full Deeploy API flow (next section).","In a production deployment, partners and developers use the Deeploy API to run workloads across the Oracle/Edge subnetwork. Conceptually, Deeploy acts like a decentralized “cloud controller” built on blockchain oracles. Clients submit their job request (container image, config, etc.) to Deeploy, and behind the scenes a chain of checks and consensus steps ensures security and validity. The high-level flow is:","Job Submission. The developer calls the Deeploy REST API (or UI) with their job parameters. This request must be properly formatted (e.g. JSON with image name, resource limits, etc.).","Identity & Signing. Deeploy verifies an EVM-compatible digital signature attached to the request. This signature (from your private key) proves you authorized this job. It also ties the request to your on-chain account for payment and auditing. See below JSON request for more in-depth understanding","Escrow (PoAI) Verification. The system checks that you have locked up sufficient funds in a smart contract (often called a Proof-of-Intent or escrow transaction). This ensures nodes will be paid for the work. Deeploy queries the blockchain to confirm the escrow tx is in place before proceeding.","Job Validation. Deeploy’s validator nodes inspect the request for correctness. They might check that the container image is from a trusted registry, that required on-chain licenses or approvals exist, and that the requested resources are reasonable. Any safety filters (e.g. data privacy restrictions) are enforced here.","Scheduling & Consensus. Once the job is signed, paid, and validated, Deeploy broadcasts it to the Oracle/Edge node subnetwork. An Oracle node from a set of supervisor/oracle nodes that uses practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (pBFT) consensus protocol to agree on worker node availability will select or directly deliver the job to the targeted nodes. Basically these nodes determine which Edge Node(s) should run the container (based on current load, capabilities, or geographic location). Later on, multi-phase consensus ensures that even if some nodes are malicious or failing, the job routing remains correct and trust-minimized.","Deployment & Runtime. The selected Edge Node(s) pull the container and launch it. They report back to the network (and the original client) with status updates or results. Throughout execution, nodes monitor the container and handle issues like restarts or load balancing – all under the broader governance of the Ratio1 network. Importantly, because the entire process is anchored on-chain, each step is auditable and tamper-resistant.","Looking under the hood and comparing with our above SDK example the same Deeploy production-grade request has a similar look to the below figure:","The above example presents the simplicity.","Partners and customers can interact with Deeploy in two main ways. For ease-of-use, Ratio1 provides a reference web dApp/UI that lets you submit jobs with a few clicks. Alternatively, enterprise users and platforms can call the Deeploy API directly from their own dashboards or CI/CD pipelines. In either case, the underlying protocol flow – signature check, escrow, consensus scheduling – is the same.","Deeploy implements a sophisticated command sending system that operates at two distinct levels, providing both precision and convenience for managing distributed applications","The instance-level command system (send_instance_command) offers granular control over specific application instances. This approach is ideal when you need to target particular nodes or instances with precise commands.","Direct targeting of specific instances","Requires detailed knowledge of:","Target nodes","Plugin signatures","Instance IDs","Application IDs","No automatic discovery process","Suitable for precise, targeted operations","The application-level command system (send_app_command) provides a more streamlined approach to command distribution. This higher-level abstraction simplifies the management of distributed applications by handling the discovery and routing of commands automatically.","Simplified interface requiring only the application ID","Automatic discovery of:","Running nodes","Relevant plugin instances","Instance locations","Intelligent command distribution","Reduced management overhead","Deeploy's command system is particularly powerful when managing containerized applications. Let's explore how to handle common container operations like restarting or stopping containers across your distributed system.","The stop command provides a direct way to terminate a container instance. When executed, it immediately halts the container's operation, stops the associated log collection process, and terminates any active ngrok tunnel. The command also ensures that all container logs are saved to disk before shutdown. After stopping, the container won't automatically restart unless explicitly commanded to do so.","The restart command offers a way to refresh a container instance. It performs a complete cycle of stopping and starting the container. When executed, it first stops the container (including log collection and ngrok tunnel), saves the logs, and then starts a fresh instance of the container. During the restart, the system follows the image pull policy that was specified during container creation - if the policy is set to \"always\", it will check for and pull any new versions of the container image before starting the new instance. This ensures that your container can be updated with the latest image version during the restart process.","Both commands can be sent either to specific instances or to all instances of an application, providing flexibility in managing container lifecycles across your distributed system.","The Ratio1 SDK provides a powerful way to interact with the Deeploy API, enabling developers to manage AI pipelines and applications in a secure and authenticated manner. The ex19_deeploy_example.py provides a ready-to-use CLI tool that enables developers to interact with the Deeploy API. It's not just a learning resource but a practical utility that can be used in real-world scenarios to manage AI pipelines and applications.","The tutorial showcases several important capabilities:","Building and signing messages for Deeploy API requests","Sending authenticated requests to the Deeploy API","Handling responses","Managing pipelines and applications","Python 3.x","Ratio1 SDK","A private key file in PEM format","The tutorial covers five main endpoints:","get_apps - Retrieve list of applications","create_pipeline - Create new AI pipelines","delete_pipeline - Remove existing pipelines","send_app_command - Send commands to applications","send_instance_command - Send commands to specific instances","1. --private-key","Type: String (file path)","Required: Yes","Description: Path to your PEM format private key file","Example: --private-key /path/to/your/private-key.pem","Purpose: Used for authenticating requests to the Deeploy API","Security Note: Must be a valid PEM file containing your Ethereum private key","2. --endpoint","Type: String","Default: 'create_pipeline'","Choices:","create_pipeline","delete_pipeline","get_apps","send_app_command","Send_instance_command","Description: Specifies which API endpoint to call","Example: --endpoint get_apps","1. --key-password","Required: No","Default: None","Description: Password for the private key file (if the key is encrypted)","Example: --key-password \"your_password\"","Note: Only needed if your private key file is password-protected","2. --request","Description: Path to the JSON file containing the request data","Example: --request /path/to/request.json","Note: Required for all endpoints except get_apps","1.

Send instance command:","Example request.json for sending instance command:","In summary, this hybrid architecture delivers the best of both worlds: cloud-like ease of deploying containers and decentralized trust and scalability. By distributing orchestration across a blockchain-secured network of nodes, Deeploy avoids single points of failure and leverages idle resources worldwide. It’s especially well-suited for AI and IoT use cases: AI inference services can run on edge servers close to data sources (reducing latency), and any device owner can monetize spare capacity in a transparent way. As one expert notes, oracle-based networks can perform off-chain computation with trust guarantees, offering more performance than on-chain-only logic. Ratio1’s approach turns every eligible machine into a potential “AI server” and makes large-scale app hosting decentralized, secure, and cost-efficient.","Key Takeaways: The Ratio1 Deeploy model (the API, underlying mechanics and the dApp UX) enables scalable, secure, decentralized cloud hosting. It automates containerized workloads across many edge machines, while using blockchain for identity, payment, and consensus. This means developers get the familiar orchestration workflow they need, but without relying on a centralized cloud provider. As edge computing grows (5G, IoT, AI at the edge), such decentralized orchestration platforms are increasingly important for meeting demand in a flexible, resilient way.","Ratio1’s architecture builds on concepts from edge orchestration and blockchain. These principles underpin how Deeploy brings Kubernetes‑style deployment to a distributed, trust-minimized network.","Andrei Ionut Damian","May 8, 2025","‹ Ratio1 Mainnet Launch: A New Era for Decentralized AI","Ratio1: The AI System That Puts You in Control ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

In blockchain, closed token allocations, undisclosed vesting, or silent backdoors lead to market manipulation.

This architecture ensures that every license holder must operate a functional and accessible Ratio1 Edge Node to participate in the network's token generation process.","The protocol operates through a carefully designed three-tier licensing system, each serving distinct roles within the ecosystem:","The Genesis Node Deed represents the foundational compute infrastructure of the Ratio1 Protocol, exclusively held by the Ratio1 Foundation. This unique license activates \"edge node zero\" and controls 28.9% of the total token allocation, distributed over a 12-month emission period. The GND serves as the cornerstone for launching the entire Ratio1 ecosystem and generating tokens for publicly disclosed Foundation pools.","Master Node Deeds are specialized licenses allocated to the development team and initial investors, representing 26.1% of the protocol's total supply. These licenses feature an extended vesting schedule of 30 months, commencing in January 2026. MND holders operate oracle nodes that support core ecosystem functions, but importantly, they cannot participate in Proof of AI mining - all their computational workloads are provided without compensation to benefit the broader community.","Standard Node Deeds constitute the primary public participation mechanism, representing 45% of the overall protocol allocation. Each ND carries a fixed allocation of 1,575 tokens, mineable over 36 months from the moment the associated Ratio1 Edge Node becomes operational. Unlike MND licenses, ND holders can execute paid computational jobs and earn rewards through both Proof of Availability and Proof of AI mechanisms.","The Ratio1 Protocol combines traditional Proof of Authority consensus with the emerging Proof of AI mechanism. While Proof of Authority typically relies on identity and reputation-based validation for fast, efficient consensus, Ratio1's implementation of Proof of AI represents a cutting-edge approach where nodes validate their integrity through compute-intensive AI training tasks. This dual-consensus model ensures both network security and meaningful AI computational work, directing verification resources toward valuable AI applications rather than arbitrary computational puzzles.","The tokenomics structure creates distinct economic incentives across license types. ND license holders benefit from both network availability rewards and AI computational job payments, encouraging active participation in the decentralized compute network. Conversely, MND holders contribute their computational resources freely to support network infrastructure, with their compensation coming solely from their allocated token vesting schedule. This design ensures that founders and early investors remain committed to long-term network health while allowing public participants to earn from productive AI workloads.","The protocol's total supply of 161,803,398 tokens reflects the mathematical inspiration drawn from the Golden Ratio, emphasizing the project's commitment to balanced, sustainable growth.

R1setup (Multi-Node Launcher) streamlines this process with an easy-to-use CLI. This free, open-source tool from Ratio1 automates the provisioning of GPU nodes (installing Docker, NVIDIA drivers, and more) using just SSH access and a few prompts. In the latest release, R1setup introduces powerful new features for node management and monitoring:","One-line installer: Quick setup of the R1setup CLI via a simple shell script.","Interactive configuration: Guided prompts define your cluster (node addresses, credentials, network).","Automated GPU setup: Installs Docker, NVIDIA drivers & CUDA, and GPU container tooling on each node.","Scalable deployment: Configure and deploy to dozens of nodes in one go.","Redesigned menu: A clear, categorized menu (Configuration, Deployment, Operations, Monitoring, Advanced) for intuitive navigation.","Individual node control: Start, stop, or restart each node’s service directly from the menu.","Advanced utilities: SSH into any node, stream or export logs, and export private keys for migrations.","Enhanced status reporting: Offline or unreachable nodes are flagged, and container health is clearly shown.","Automatic updates: R1setup now checks for and applies the latest version when you run it.","Graceful offline handling: Unreachable nodes are detected and skipped without blocking the process.","Below we walk through R1setup’s workflow and highlight these capabilities.","Begin by installing R1setup on your control machine (e.g., your PC or a master server). The GitHub repo provides a one-line installer script. Run it locally (you do not need to execute it on each node):","Note: The Multi Node Launcher (R1setup) CLI can be run from Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Native Windows environments are not supported for running R1setup.","Important: Run this script from your configuration machine (your local computer). You do not need to run this script directly on your remote machines - the script will configure and deploy to your remote nodes for you.","This script sets up R1setup in a Python virtual environment and installs all prerequisites (Python, Ansible, etc.). When it finishes, you should see a message like “Installation complete!”, and the r1setup command will be available system-wide.","After installing, you're ready to launch the tool. Running r1setup for the first time will bring up an interactive prompt to create a new configuration. A configuration in R1setup is a file that stores your deployment settings: which nodes (machines) you want to set up, how to access them, and which network environment they will join.","When you execute r1setup, it detects that you have no configuration yet and asks to create one. Just follow the prompts:","Name your configuration: e.g. gpu-cluster-prod.","Choose a network: mainnet, testnet, or devnet (for Ratio1 nodes).","Specify number of GPU nodes: Enter how many servers you want to set up.","Enter node details: For each node, provide a friendly alias (name), IP address or hostname, SSH username, and authentication (password or key). You can also specify a sudo password if needed.","Creating a new configuration in R1setup is straightforward. In the screenshot above, we start a configuration named \"my-super-configuration\" and choose the mainnet network. We then configure 2 GPU nodes, providing its aliases (\"mysmart-node\" and \"my-super-node\"), IP addresses (192.168.0.110 and 192.168.0.110), SSH username, and password. R1setup summarizes the info for confirmation (host, user, auth method) and saves the configuration file. The configuration is now active and ready for deployment.","Notably, you can add as many nodes as you need in a single configuration. For instance, if you input \"5\" for the number of nodes, the tool will repeat the node detail prompts five times (one for each server). This makes it easy to set up a whole cluster in one go. (You can always manage configurations later to add or remove nodes, as we'll see.)","Once a configuration is created, R1setup drops you into its main menu interface. The updated main menu (shown below) displays the active configuration name, network, and a summary of node status. It is organized into sections like Configuration, Deployment, Operations, Monitoring & Info, and Advanced. In this example, the status line shows “Nodes (2): 1 unreachable, 1 running” (with a red X icon for the offline node). Under Operations, you’ll see new options to Start, Stop, or Restart each node’s service. The header also shows the last deployment time and performs an automatic update check when you launch the CLI.","R1setup’s updated main menu displays the configuration status and available actions. Here, one node is unreachable (red) and one is running (green). New menu sections (Operations and Advanced) give you quick access to start/stop nodes, SSH, and other utilities.","At this point, you can:","View configuration: Show details of all nodes (aliases, addresses, etc.) to double-check settings.","Test connectivity: Verify SSH access to each node (the tool will report any unreachable machines).","Add or edit nodes: Add new servers to the config or update existing entries without recreating the config.","Switch configurations: If you have multiple saved clusters (e.g. dev vs prod), switch between them easily.","For now, we’ll proceed with deploying the full software stack to the configured nodes.","With your nodes configured, choose the Deploy full setup option. R1setup will install everything needed on each machine, including:","Docker Engine & Docker Compose: container runtime.","NVIDIA GPU drivers & CUDA: GPU acceleration support.","NVIDIA Container Toolkit: allow Docker to use GPUs.","Ratio1 Edge Node Service: the node software (for running on mainnet).","R1setup will first show you a summary of the planned actions and the target nodes. Review this and type y to proceed. The tool then connects to each node via Ansible and performs all the installation steps automatically. You will see status messages as packages install on each machine (the NVIDIA drivers can take several minutes).","When the deployment finishes, R1setup indicates success or failure for each node. A successful run shows all tasks completed (e.g. ok=<tasks> 0 failures) and a “Full Deployment completed successfully!” message with a green checkmark. The configuration is updated to record that a deployment has been run. Each remote machine now has Docker, NVIDIA software, and the edge-node container running.","You can extend your deployment at any time. For example, if you add more servers to the configuration and run Deploy full setup again, R1setup will automatically install the required software on just those new machines. This rinse-and-repeat process scales easily: whether you add one node or twenty, the tool handles them for you.","After deployment, R1setup provides detailed status screens and controls for your nodes. For example, the Container Status view shows each node’s container state. In the example below, one node is marked Unreachable (red) and the other running (green). The list provides Start, Stop, and Restart buttons for each service, so you can control nodes on-demand without SSHing into them manually.","Container Status: Shows each node’s container state. In this example, one node is Unreachable (red) and the other is running (green). Buttons let you Start, Stop, or Restart each service.","Node Addresses: Displays each node’s blockchain address (skipping any offline hosts so they don’t cause errors).","Test Connectivity: Quickly re-checks SSH access to all nodes and reports how many are reachable.","In the Container Status screen above, “my-super-node” is unreachable (red) and “my-smart-node” is running (green). You can start or stop each node’s service right from this interface.","These monitoring tools help you spot offline nodes immediately and troubleshoot connectivity. They also mean you no longer need to juggle separate SSH sessions for basic node operations.","R1setup’s Advanced menu offers maintenance tools for expert users.","For example:","SSH into a node: Open an SSH session to any configured machine using the saved credentials.","Stream or export logs: Tail the node service’s logs in real time, or write them to a local file for analysis.","Import private keys: Collect each node’s wallet key file for safe backup or migration.","The new Advanced menu includes SSH and logging utilities (as well as security tools).","One particularly powerful feature is the Import Private Keys (expert mode) option. Selecting this will log into each node and copy the private key file that controls its blockchain wallet. As shown below, R1setup saves each key locally under node_keys/{node_name}_e2.pem. You can then transfer these keys to new hardware if you need to migrate a node - the node will keep its original wallet address.","The Import Private Keys process retrieves and saves the wallet key from each node. Each key is saved in node_keys/{alias}_e2.pem, allowing seamless node migration without changing addresses.","These advanced utilities give you full control. Need to debug a node? Just SSH in from the menu or fetch its logs. Want to safely move a node to another machine? Export its keys. The CLI keeps all these tasks in one place.","Managing a GPU cluster or deploying blockchain-based AI nodes doesn't have to be a headache. R1setup simplifies the process to the point where anyone with basic SSH access can get a multi-node GPU environment up and running. This is especially useful for scalability - whether you're an individual setting up a few machines or an organization provisioning dozens of nodes, the same tool and process apply. No special DevOps knowledge is required; R1setup abstracts away the complexity of driver installations, Docker setup, and configuration management.","Another important aspect is that R1setup is free and open source. The project is available on GitHub, which means you can inspect the code, suggest improvements, or even tailor it to your own needs. Being open source also ensures transparency in what the tool is doing on your machines.","For the Ratio1 community, R1setup provides a fast path to becoming a node operator. If you want to join the Ratio1 network by running edge nodes, this launcher automates the entire bootstrap. And even beyond Ratio1, the ability to quickly equip servers with Docker and NVIDIA drivers has broad utility in AI and GPU computing projects.","Get Started Now: If you’re ready to try R1setup, head over to the r1setup repository for the latest instructions. The one-liner installation script in the mnl_factory directory makes setup a breeze. In just a few minutes, you can go from zero to a full GPU cluster - no more wrestling with individual server configs.

At the forefront of this revolution stands Ratio1, an AI meta-operating system that promises to democratize artificial intelligence through a \"compute ride-sharing\" model. However, like any platform that relies on distributed participants, Ratio1 faces a critical challenge: how to maintain network integrity while preserving the decentralized ethos that defines the ecosystem.","The answer lies in what some consider a controversial approach: a governance system that can freeze or permanently ban Node Deed owners who violate protocol standards. This policy has already sparked debates about the balance between network security and decentralized autonomy, raising questions that echo broader discussions in the distributed computing industry.","At its core, Ratio1 Protocol is envisioned as an operating system for AI that runs on a decentralized network of devices.

By tapping into widely dispersed resources, Ratio1 can reduce latency (compute happens closer to users) and improve scalability and cost-efficiency (idle hardware gets utilized via microtransactions). The vision is “AI for everyone” in a literal sense: if you have a device with spare cycles, you can contribute it; if you have an idea for an AI app, you can deploy it without owning hardware.","Ratio1 employs a sophisticated three-tier licensing structure that governs participation in the network. Genesis Node Deeds (GND) are exclusively held by the Ratio1 Foundation and control 28.9% of token allocation, while Master Node Deeds (MND) are allocated 12.5% to development teams (~11%)  and initial investors (~2%) while the remaining 13.1% of the MNDs are destined for strategic future VC. The remaining 45%, the biggest allocation of the protocol, comes from standard Node Deeds (ND), which constitute the primary public participation mechanism and enable individual edge node operation within the ecosystem.","One of the things that sets Ratio1 ecosystem apart is its dual consensus mechanism combining Proof of Availability (PoA) and Proof of AI (PoAI): PoA mining ensures that every license holder must operate a functional and accessible edge node to participate in token generation, creating genuine utility rather than speculative participation while PoAI ensure the fair distribution of the job fees as rewards.","Unlike traditional cloud providers that primarily rely on contractual agreements and service suspensions, Ratio1's governance system is built into the protocol's fundamental architecture. The platform's approach to node governance reflects the unique challenges of managing a decentralized network where participants contribute actual computing resources rather than simply consuming services.","The Ratio1 Edge Node software requires specific hardware minimums (a 64-bit CPU, ~16GB of RAM, 4 cores, and 200GB of storage) and operates through proprietary communication protocols leveraging IoT-based technologies such as MQTT or base technologies such as IPFS. However, this infrastructure dependency creates multiple potential points of failure or manipulation that traditional centralized systems usually don't face. For example, edge nodes in general are particularly vulnerable to tampering, with attackers potentially able to \"tamper with node circuits\" and \"change or modify node software and operating systems\" - things that do happen with various commercially off-the-shelf products. These vulnerabilities become critical in a decentralized network where compromised nodes could affect the entire ecosystem's integrity. Not to mention the fact that these nodes run consumer systems with consumers' confidential data.","Ratio1's governance system specifically targets several categories of misconduct that could compromise network integrity. The primary violations include tampering with Edge Node software, interfering with consensus protocol operations, disrupting communications systems, and any modifications beyond normal operational parameters. When such violations are detected, the platform initiates a graduated response system both automated as well as manual.","The process begins with license freezing, where the offending node's ability to participate in the network is temporarily suspended pending investigation. This initial step allows for fact-finding while preventing further potential damage to the network. If the investigation confirms protocol violations, the freeze can become permanent, effectively \"blacklisting\" the node operator from future participation.","The KYC requirement makes this process even more practical as the team can identify and contact the node operator, and if needed, provide information to authorities. It’s a level of accountability uncommon in blockchain networks, effectively preventing the “anonymous rogue miner” scenario.","This approach draws parallels to blacklisting practices across the computing industry, meaning that in traditional computing contexts, blacklisting serves as \"a basic access control mechanism that allows through all elements (email addresses, users, passwords, URLs, IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, etc.), except those explicitly mentioned.","Ratio1's governance system relies on sophisticated monitoring capabilities to detect protocol violations. The platform's architecture includes oracle consensus mechanisms and signature-based validation systems that can identify unauthorized modifications to edge node software. Ratio1's consensus mechanism must balance multiple competing concerns: ensuring network security, maintaining decentralization, and preserving performance. The platform's use of both Proof of Availability and Proof of AI creates multiple verification layers, but also multiple potential points of failure or manipulation.","The challenge of managing distributed computing participants isn't unique to Ratio1. Major cloud providers face similar issues, though their solutions typically focus on different aspects of the problem. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure all maintain sophisticated policies for handling account suspensions and service violations.","Managing a decentralized network presents unique technical challenges that centralized platforms don't face. Research in blockchain-enabled decentralized trust management highlights the complexity of maintaining system integrity across distributed nodes.","The most controversial aspect of Ratio1's governance system lies in the tension between decentralized principles and centralized enforcement. While critics might argue that the ability to permanently freeze node licenses contradicts the fundamental ethos of decentralized computing, where participants should have autonomy over their contributed resources, the reality is that the end consumer using the decentralized resources provided by the Edge Node operators must be protected from any malicious attacks, even if the data, processing and applications are sharded across the Ratio1 computing continuum.","Ratio1’s design is different by intent as it explicitly opts for governance and compliance to make the network reliable and legally viable.","To better understand Ratio1’s model, let’s compare it to a few alternatives:","1. Golem Network (Decentralized Compute Marketplace): Golem is one of the earliest “Airbnb for compute” projects. It allows users to rent out CPU/GPU power in a peer-to-peer market, earning Golem tokens (GLM) from requesters who need tasks done. Unlike Ratio1, Golem does not require any license or KYC - anyone can install the Golem node and start offering resources. Golem’s approach is more purely decentralized: it relies on sandboxing and reputation. It’s up to requesters to choose providers and perhaps use redundancy or verification if they don’t trust a node. There is no central authority to ban a Golem node; if a provider misbehaves (e.g., returns bad results), they might not get paid and might develop a bad reputation, but they can always try again under another identity. In fact, the Golem team noted that without adding something like KYC or a robust verification consensus, there will always be ways to try to game the system.","2. Akash Network (Decentralized Cloud Infrastructure): Akash is a more recent project (built on Cosmos) that creates a marketplace for cloud compute, often compared to a “decentralized AWS.” Providers on Akash (who typically run data centers or servers) offer their capacity and set prices in AKT token, and users deploy containers to them via an on-chain bidding system. Like Golem, Akash is permissionless - no explicit KYC, and any operator can participate by staking some AKT and registering as a provider. Apparently Akash does incorporate a form of staking and escrow: when a deployment is agreed, the user’s payment is held in escrow and released as the provider keeps the service running. If either party misbehaves or the service goes down, there are protocols for termination and refund. It is unclear exactly what happens when users deploy critical applications with highly confidential data such as medical applications or fintech systems - once the harm was done.","3. Traditional Cloud and Hosting (AWS, Hetzner, etc.): On the other end of the spectrum, we have fully centralized providers. If you use Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, you are bound by their terms of service and these companies aggressively enforce policies. AWS can (and will) suspend accounts for things like hosting illegal content, launching DDoS attacks, or even for billing issues. The user has no anonymity - you likely gave credit card and personal details.","Ratio1 sits somewhat in the middle of these models. It aspires to AWS-like ease of use and reliability (managed deployment, compliance, support) while utilizing a decentralized network of independent nodes like Golem/Akash. But to reconcile the two, Ratio1 introduces identity and governance from the start. In effect, Ratio1’s compute providers are more like franchisees or licensed operators rather than random anonymous participants. This is a model we see in some “decentralized” industries: for instance, ride-sharing companies often require driver background checks and can deactivate drivers who don’t meet standards, even though drivers use their own cars. Similarly, Ratio1 requires KYC for node operators and can deactivate those who don’t meet the standards, even though it’s the operators’ own machines doing the work.","From a user perspective, Ratio1’s approach provides higher trust in the results. If you deploy an AI model on Ratio1, you might take comfort that nodes are run by known entities who have to invest in a license and won’t risk being banned by tampering with your computation. On Golem, if you deploy an AI task, you might have to build in yourself verification steps because you don’t really know who’s computing your data - it could be many anonymous machines from anywhere.","Finally, another implication is regulatory acceptance. By incorporating KYC and enforceable terms, Ratio1 finds it easier to work with businesses and regulators. A completely permissionless network can run into issues - for instance, if illegal content or sanctioned parties start using it, there’s no easy way to intervene. Ratio1’s design means it could block a sanctioned user or illicit use case if required, which could prevent the whole network from getting into legal hot water. Not to mention the fact that the majority of the market requires clear data governance, reliability and strong operational resilience, both in enterprise environments as well as for small and medium companies.","Andrei Ionut Damian","Jun 18, 2025","‹ Keysoft’s journey: from legacy systems to AI-powered platform with Ratio1","Ratio1.ai: Comprehensive Partnership Strategy and Platform Overview ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

This two-phase technological transformation showcases how a traditional enterprise can leverage decentralized, edge-optimized cloud and specialized custom deep learning and AI agents to enhance scalability, agility, and developer productivity.","Keysoft is a Romanian software company (founded in 2001) known for its high-performance information management platform and bespoke enterprise applications. They serve a broad range of industries - from customs and finance to healthcare, media, and auditing.  Keysoft’s platform could take a project from concept to production in 1 month versus the typical 6+ months and this was for many years the key value proposition. Nevertheless, in a landscape of continuous innovation and technological disruption, the company management decided and urged the need to modernize its legacy architecture to keep pace with evolving technology standards. To achieve this, Keysoft partnered with Ratio1 - a pioneering decentralized cloud and AI platform - to execute a dramatic two-phase transformation.","In Phase 1, Keysoft overhauled its deployment strategy by embracing containerization, continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD), and Ratio1’s Deeploy orchestration system. In Phase 2, Keysoft augmented its applications with advanced AI capabilities, leveraging Ratio1’s AI ecosystem to introduce intelligent code generation and domain-specific machine learning features. This case study details how Keysoft successfully navigated both phases, blending cutting-edge infrastructure with AI innovation to revitalize its product suite and better serve industries like finance, healthcare, and audit in 2025 and beyond.","In the first phase, Keysoft focused on migrating from a traditional 3-tier legacy system to a modern cloud-native environment. Originally, Keysoft’s software was deployed in a classic on-premises model: a Windows-based application server (with a proprietary logic engine and “K-script” language) connected to a relational database (SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle) and a thin client GUI. This setup, while stable, posed typical legacy challenges - manual deployments, limited scalability, single points of failure, and difficulties in continuous updating. Keysoft’s development team often had to roll out updates by installing new versions on each client’s server, and scaling up for higher loads meant provisioning additional dedicated servers (with data synchronization hurdles).","To eliminate these pain points, Keysoft adopted Ratio1 containerization and DevOps best practices, converting its application into Docker container images and establishing a CI/CD pipeline. Each new software version is now automatically built and packaged as a container, ensuring that it runs the same everywhere (solving the “works on my machine” problem). Containers encapsulate all necessary code, libraries, and settings, so deploying Keysoft’s app became as simple as launching the container on a target environment. Containers also start faster and use resources more efficiently than the old VM-based deployments which improved Keysoft’s resource utilization.","Keysoft didn’t just move to any cloud - they moved to Ratio1’s decentralized orchestration platform, Deeploy, to deploy and manage these containers. Ratio1 Deeploy essentially brings “the power and flexibility of cloud-native orchestration (like Kubernetes) to the edge, but without relying on any centralized data center. Instead of hosting Keysoft’s app on a single server or a traditional cloud provider, Ratio1 uses a distributed network of nodes (potentially spread across multiple locations and owners) to run the containers. This unique approach, coordinated by blockchain and smart contracts, provides several tangible benefits:","High Availability & Horizontal Scaling: Deeploy automatically handles replication and scaling of containers across multiple nodes. If demand for Keysoft’s application increases, Deeploy can spin up additional container instances on different nodes; if a node fails or goes offline, another node seamlessly takes over the workload . This means Keysoft’s services now have no single point of failure - uptime is greatly improved compared to the old single-server setup. Even during maintenance or outages in one location, the application remains available on other nodes, which is crucial for mission-critical uses (e.g. a healthcare client’s system can keep running locally even if cloud connectivity is lost)","Decentralized Edge Deployment: Ratio1’s edge-first design allows Keysoft to deploy applications closer to end-users or data sources when needed. For example, a Keysoft installation for a hospital can run on hospital-owned Ratio1 nodes on-premises to meet data sovereignty requirements, while still being part of the global orchestration. Deeploy was built to handle the dynamic nature of edge computing with “extreme high-availability horizontal scaling” on heterogeneous nodes. Nodes can be regular servers, cloud VMs, or even PCs - any authorized device and KYB-ed node operator can join the Ratio1 network to contribute compute. The platform’s trust-minimized blockchain coordination ensures that tasks are assigned and verified transparently across these participants. In short, Keysoft can now run its software on a coalition of distributed mini-clouds rather than a single cluster, improving resilience and performance for clients in different regions.","Seamless Container Orchestration & DevOps Integration: Developers at Keysoft found Ratio1 familiar in workflow. They package the software in standard OCI/Docker containers and declare resource needs (CPU, memory, etc.) as usual. The Deeploy platform then securely distributes and runs these containers on suitable edge nodes in the network. It takes care of crucial orchestration tasks automatically - starting/stopping containers, restarting them on another node if one fails, scaling out/in based on load, and monitoring health - all of this without any central Kubernetes master or manual intervention. This “DevOps-free” deployment model let Keysoft’s small team achieve reliability on par with big cloud setups, but without maintaining their own Kubernetes cluster or hiring dedicated site reliability engineers. Ratio1’s open-standards approach also meant Keysoft did not have to rewrite their software - the existing app could be migrated as-is into containers and deployed on Ratio1 with minimal changes.","Integrated Decentralized Services (R1FS & ChainStore): By moving onto Ratio1, Keysoft’s applications can leverage built-in decentralized services that enhance a cloud-native app. Two notable ones are ChainStore and R1FS. ChainStore is Ratio1’s Redis-like key-value store that operates across multiple nodes, allowing Keysoft’s container instances to share state and communicate in real-time even when running on different machines. For instance, if Keysoft’s app modules need a fast caching layer or a distributed session store in a scaled-out scenario, ChainStore provides that without relying on a single in-memory database server. R1FS is Ratio1’s distributed file system (built on IPFS) which gives Keysoft a private, encrypted storage layer for files, data exports, or backups, with full data ownership and no censorship. Instead of uploading documents or attachments to a third-party cloud storage, Keysoft apps can now store them on R1FS - the data is automatically synced peer-to-peer among the network and remains accessible even if one node drops, with content addressing ensuring integrity. These tools allowed Keysoft to match (or exceed) the capabilities of modern cloud platforms in their product: e.g., an audit firm using Keysoft can securely share large reports via R1FS (no central file server needed), and a CRM built on Keysoft can use ChainStore to keep multiple running instances in sync. All data is encrypted and stays within the customer’s trust boundary, addressing privacy concerns out-of-the-box.","Cost Efficiency & Flexibility: By using Ratio1’s network, Keysoft can also potentially reduce hosting costs and gain flexibility in provisioning. The Ratio1 model taps into a pool of distributed compute resources - some provided by smaller data centers or even spare capacity - often at lower cost than traditional cloud VMs. Keysoft now pays only for the resources its containers actually consume on this shared network, in a usage-based model, avoiding the expense of idle dedicated servers. Deeploy’s economic design (with its token-based escrow and pay-for-uptime contracts) ensures that Keysoft gets reliable service from nodes while cloud service providers on the network compete at fair prices. In addition, Ratio1’s data sovereignty features allow Keysoft or its clients to specify where data should (or should not) run. Need to keep a database within the EU for GDPR compliance? Deeploy can restrict container placement to European nodes. Want an extra backup node on-premise? A local Ratio1 node can be added to the deployment. This level of control, combined with the inherent auditability of blockchain (every deployment action can be logged immutably), gave Keysoft and its enterprise customers greater confidence in moving to a cloud-like platform.","By the end of Phase 1, Keysoft had effectively transformed its infrastructure: moving from “old-school” manual deployments on single servers to an automated, containerized deployment on a decentralized cloud. The immediate outcomes were faster release cycles, as CI/CD pipelines deliver updates seamlessly to containers, and improved reliability due to Ratio1’s self-healing, multi-node design. Keysoft’s small team could manage many client installations through one interface (the Deeploy dashboard/API) instead of juggling individual servers. This lays a robust foundation where scalability, uptime, and global accessibility are no longer limitations for Keysoft’s software. It also set the stage for the next phase: capitalizing on Ratio1’s built-in AI capabilities to enhance the software’s functionality.","Traditionally, Keysoft’s platform featured a DDL/DML SQL editor and a proprietary K-script for workflow automation. In partnership with Ratio1.ai, these editors evolved into high-level specification interfaces. At the same time, building on Ratio1’s neuro-symbolic framework and tokenized economy, Keysoft integrated domain-specific AI deep learning model pipelines. With the move to Ratio1’s ecosystem, Keysoft gained access to a suite of AI tools and “agents” that could be embedded into their applications. Phase 2 of the transformation leveraged these capabilities to introduce game-changing features powered by artificial intelligence, aligning perfectly with Keysoft’s mission of “designing business logic, not code”. In essence, Keysoft shifted from a traditional low-code platform into an AI-assisted development platform - drastically simplifying how new features are created and how end-users interact with the system. Last but not least the new proposed paradigm of Ratio1: “Your AI, you Data” where the final consumers are truly in possession of their data.","One of the pain points in enterprise software is writing complex database queries or definitions by hand. Keysoft’s system historically provided a DDL/DML SQL editor for advanced users to define data schema or craft custom queries. Now, that module has been reinvented as a Specifications Editor, where users can simply describe in plain English what they need from the database, and an AI agent automatically generates the SQL code. For example, instead of manually coding a query to pull “the top 5 products sold in the last month”, a user can just ask for that in natural language - the AI will understand the request and produce the correct SQL behind the scenes. This is made possible by Ratio1’s specialized SQL Agent, an LLM (Large Language Model) fine-tuned for SQL generation. Such an agent “translates natural language queries into SQL commands to retrieve data from relational databases”, essentially acting as a query copilot. In Keysoft’s context, the agent is further customized with knowledge of the Keysoft database schema and business terms, so it can generate Keysoft-specific SQL that is syntactically correct and semantically appropriate for the application’s data model. The benefit is enormous: non-technical analysts can get the data they need without writing a single line of SQL, and experts save time on writing and debugging queries. This follows a broader industry trend of using LLM-powered “SQL assistants” to make data access more intuitive and self-service. Keysoft’s integration of an Ratio1 native NL2SQL agent has increased productivity and opened up data analysis to a wider audience within client organizations.","Keysoft’s platform includes a proprietary scripting language (“K-script”) used to implement custom business rules and workflows within the applications. Writing K-script traditionally required knowledge of Keysoft’s API and some programming effort - typically done by Keysoft’s team or trained power users. To drastically simplify this, Keysoft worked with Ratio1 to deploy an AI code generation assistant that can produce K-script code from a high-level description. Now, a business analyst can literally tell the system, “I need a feature that calculates late fees for overdue invoices and sends a reminder email”, and the AI agent will generate the corresponding K-script logic to implement that feature. This capability is akin to having a smart co-developer who understands Keysoft’s entire codebase and framework. In fact, Ratio1’s own flagship AI assistant, Ratio1 J33VES, is described as an AI “team simulator” that “understands your entire codebase, enabling rapid, full-context coding and problem-solving… from pinpointing bugs to generating production-ready code”. Keysoft leveraged this concept by training an AI model on its platform’s existing modules (the “100 individual business objects and modules” that Keysoft’s engine consists of) so that the AI has a private knowledge base of how features are implemented. This means the AI doesn’t create code in a vacuum - it writes new script in line with Keysoft’s established patterns and data structures, ensuring the generated code fits seamlessly with the existing system (no syntactic errors or incompatible logic). The AI essentially functions as a Keysoft expert developer on demand, available 24/7. It can take on multiple roles in the development process: writing code, suggesting improvements, checking for edge cases, and even explaining the code to the human user. This continuous dialog and refinement loop is similar to how advanced systems like J33VES work with developers until a problem is solved. The result for Keysoft is a radical reduction in development time and effort for customizations - many tasks that used to require a programmer can now be accomplished by a business analyst working with the AI assistant. This empowerment of non-developers through AI is a key trend in modern software: studies have shown “AI generation of boilerplate code and unit tests significantly reduces manual coding effort”, freeing up humans to focus on higher-level design.","Keysoft’s new “describe it, we build it” approach exemplifies this, making enterprise software development more conversational and intuitive.","Beyond code and queries, Keysoft also infused machine learning intelligence into the daily operations of its applications. Using Ratio1’s AI platform, they trained and deployed domain-specific predictive models to add value in different verticals. For instance, in the finance/audit sector, a Keysoft application can now include an AI model that analyzes transaction data to predict risk factors or flag anomalies (acting as an “AI auditor” assistant). In healthcare, a Keysoft module could leverage a predictive model to forecast patient appointment no-shows or optimize staff scheduling based on historical data. These models are built using deep learning techniques and hosted on the Ratio1 network, taking advantage of its support for distributed AI workloads (the platform can even perform federated learning across multiple nodes holding sensitive data, which is useful if Keysoft’s healthcare clients want to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data). Ratio1 was designed to accommodate advanced AI/ML tasks - from training to serving - as part of its “AI OS” vision, so Keysoft could plug in custom models with relative ease. Moreover, Ratio1’s privacy-focused design (data remains on user-controlled nodes, and AI models can be served locally) means these features don’t compromise confidentiality. For example, an AI model providing financial forecasts to a Keysoft CRM system can run on the client’s own infrastructure via Ratio1’s edge node, ensuring no sensitive financial data ever leaves their premises - yet they still benefit from powerful AI analytics.","To make these AI features accessible and even more, to offer users customized and specialised in-app assistants, Keysoft introduced decentralized specialized assistants within their software. Think of these as chatbot-like helpers embedded in the UI, tailored for specific roles or domains.","Domain-specific advisors, like a Healthcare Assistant that can answer questions about patient data trends (using the predictive models) or a Financial Analyst Assistant that can generate custom reports and insights from accounting data on the fly. These are feasible because Ratio1 allows fine-tuning or grounding general LLMs on proprietary data and knowledge bases. In fact, Ratio1’s J33VES is described as extending to other domains, where if it’s loaded with legal contracts or financial data, it can assist a lawyer or accountant just as well as it assists a developer. Keysoft applied this principle by creating internal knowledge bases (using R1FS to store company-specific documents, policy texts, etc., and turning them into embeddings) so that the assistants can give informed answers.","Each of these assistants runs securely and locally via Ratio1’s decentralized AI serving infrastructure where basically the Keysoft containers can access local endpoints that provide the whole range of Ratio1 features - from J33VES to R1FS and ChainStore. Keysoft’s clients loved this because it meant they could have “ChatGPT-like” functionality within their business software without sending any data to external cloud AI services. All the AI processing happens either on the customer’s own Ratio1 nodes or across the encrypted Ratio1 network, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. (As Ratio1 emphasizes: “you run the AI on your own hardware (or someone’s hardware you trust)… no middlemen, no hidden data mining”. For many industries like healthcare and finance, this is a critical advantage - they get the benefit of AI-driven automation while keeping sensitive data fully under control.","In summary, Phase 2 turned Keysoft’s product suite into a much smarter, more user-friendly platform. Tasks that used to require technical skills (writing queries, coding business logic) have been democratized through AI natural-language interfaces. End-users can interact with the system in their own language, and the heavy lifting is done by specialized AI agents behind the scenes. Keysoft’s development team, on the other hand, is supercharged by AI - their productivity in delivering new features has multiplied, as routine coding is handled by the AI assistant (indeed, developers using tools like J33VES can build features “2-4× faster than before,” according to Ratio1’s observations). Quality is improved too: the AI, having full context of the codebase, generates consistent code and can catch integration issues that a human might overlook.","All these enhancements translate into a better experience for Keysoft’s clients: faster customizations, richer analytical capabilities, and intelligent assistance available 24/7 within the application.","Phase 2 of Keysoft’s transformation - the AI-powered functionality - is currently in alpha stage and entering its initial testing round. While the architecture and core capabilities have been defined and partially integrated, broader availability will follow after further validation, refinement, and user feedback. This staged approach ensures the new AI features meet enterprise-grade quality and domain-specific expectations before public rollout.","From an industry perspective, Keysoft’s journey exemplifies the major tech trends of 2024-2025. Many organizations with legacy systems are looking to achieve exactly what Keysoft did: containerize and automate their legacy applications, move to cloud or hybrid-cloud infrastructure, and inject AI capabilities to stay competitive. Gartner and other analysts highlight containerization, CI/CD, cloud migration, and AI integration as key pillars of legacy modernization strategies in 2025. Keysoft hit all these marks in one cohesive project. Perhaps most importantly, they did so by leveraging a decentralized platform (Ratio1), which is an emerging approach that addresses concerns of privacy and control in the era of cloud computing. As more companies worry about data ownership and cloud costs, decentralized cloud frameworks like Ratio1’s could present an attractive alternative - “AWS-like experience for deploying apps, but on a distributed network”","Keysoft’s partnership with Ratio1.ai exemplifies how legacy enterprise applications can undergo a transformative two-phase modernization: first, by migrating to a decentralized container orchestration platform that ensures high-availability and scalability; and second, by embedding specialized AI agents to automate code generation, predictive analytics, and domain-specific workflows.","This case study demonstrates a clear blueprint for organizations seeking to combine low-code platforms with cutting-edge AI and decentralized infrastructure to achieve unprecedented agility and innovation.","By leveraging Ratio1’s ecosystem for both infrastructure and AI, Keysoft achieved a comprehensive modernization that touches every aspect of its business. Key outcomes of this transformation summarized include:","Greater agility and faster delivery","Improved reliability and scalability","Cost efficiency & resource optimization","Enhanced functionality and user empowerment","Alignment with industry standards","Keysoft emerges as a disruptive tech innovator","Ultimately, Keysoft emerged from this journey not just as a software vendor, but as a disruptive tech innovator in its own right - one that combined its deep industry know-how with Ratio1’s state-of-the-art technology to deliver a solution that is faster, smarter, and ready for the future.","With the platform improvements, Keysoft can explore offering its software in new ways. The decentralized cloud approach means they could provide tokenized Keysoft-as-a-Service to clients globally, deploying on Ratio1 nodes near each client for performance. The efficient DevOps means even small custom projects are economically viable, possibly opening up new markets or smaller clients that previously couldn’t afford a custom solution. The AI features give Keysoft an upsell opportunity - e.g., tiers of service where advanced AI analytics or assistants are premium features. All told, modernization not only solved technical issues but also equipped Keysoft with a more scalable business model for growth.","Petrica Butusina","Jun 19, 2025","‹ Ratio1 Node Deed (ND) Sale Launches Tuesday!","The Trust Protocol: Inside Ratio1's Node Governance and \"Blacklisting\" System ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

Its orchestration management platform, Deeploy, enables organizations to deploy and manage containerized applications across a distributed network of devices and even cloud nodes without relying on a central data center or provider. In simple terms, Deeploy brings the power and flexibility of cloud-native orchestration (like Kubernetes) to the edge of the network and beyond, using blockchain technology to coordinate resources securely. This unique approach allows businesses to run AI models and software services closer to end-users or data sources, delivering benefits such as lower costs using pooled resources, improved resilience with no central orchestrator, compliance with data regulations based on data sovereignty centered and censorship-resistant architecture, and alignment with the latest ecosystem trends. The following profile outlines Ratio1’s value proposition, target industries, example use cases, and strategic recommendations for maximizing its impact.","Ratio1 Deeploy is a decentralized orchestration management platform designed to manage containerized workloads across a distributed network of heterogeneous nodes (servers, edge devices, and more). Unlike traditional cloud orchestration which depends on centralized clusters, Deeploy runs on a trust-minimized blockchain-powered network. This means any authorized node – whether a data center server, a 5G base station, or a personal computer – can participate in hosting applications, with no single party controlling the whole system. Deeploy coordinates these nodes using smart contracts based circular tokenized economy and secure protocols, ensuring that tasks are assigned, executed, and verified in a transparent and tamper-proof manner.","Strategic Positioning: Ratio1 is strategically positioned to lead the next generation of “Your AI, your Data” infrastructure:","It focuses on edge-native deployment, meaning it was built from the ground up to handle the dynamic, fragmented nature of edge computing (where devices can come and go, and network conditions vary) using extreme high-availability horizontal scaling.","By leveraging blockchain technology for security, identity, and payment, Deeploy removes the need to trust a central cloud provider – workloads run in a trustless environment where rules are enforced by code and consensus. Anyone can be a cloud provider and anyone can be a mini-datacenter owner.","This positions Ratio1 as a technology leader for organizations looking to embrace decentralization - own your data, own your software, own your information streams -  without sacrificing the ease of managed cloud services. In essence, Ratio1 is offering an “AWS-like” experience for deploying apps, but instead of Amazon’s data centers, the compute power comes from a coalition (pooling) of distributed nodes owned by various participants - from small users to datacenter owners - with shared trustless data storage that originates from the InterPlanetary File System.","Platform Capabilities: Deeploy provides developers and IT teams with familiar tools to launch and maintain applications:","Users can package their software in standard containers (e.g. Docker images -  ie OCI) and define resource needs just as they would for any cloud deployment.","The platform then securely distributes and runs these containers on suitable edge nodes available in the Ratio1 network.","It handles important tasks like scaling (adding more instances if demand grows), fault recovery (restarting or relocating tasks if a node fails), and monitoring – all in a decentralized manner using not a central orchestrator or a set of central orchestrator but rather a whole network of trustless oracle nodes.","Because it’s built on open standards and APIs, Deeploy can integrate with existing workflows. Companies don’t have to rewrite their software; they can migrate or extend it to Ratio1’s network to take advantage of decentralization.","Ratio1 offers a native applications framework for low-code and no-code development that enables it to run advanced workloads ranging from monitoring a sensor grid to a federated deep model training process up to providing a highly decentralized LLM serving web-api.","In summary, Ratio1’s Deeploy combines the proven model of container orchestration with cutting-edge decentralization and native application development. This offers a new kind of cloud that is geographically distributed, collaboratively owned, and optimized for emerging needs at the network edge and across multiple stakeholders where censorship and data ownership is critical.","Ratio1’s and its Deeploy platform delivers clear business benefits to its ideal customers. These benefits resonate across industries, especially for organizations seeking cost-effective, resilient, and compliant infrastructure solutions. The key value propositions include:","Cost Efficiency: Deeploy can significantly reduce infrastructure and operating costs. By utilizing a decentralized network of compute resources (often tapping into underused or lower-cost devices), companies pay only for what they use, often at a lower unit cost than traditional cloud providers. There is no need to maintain large dedicated servers if the workload can be distributed to available edge nodes on-demand. This “pay-as-you-go” model, combined with competitive pricing of a shared network, helps organizations improve their ROI on compute spending. It is especially attractive for AI/ML workloads that are expensive to run on centralized clouds – Ratio1 can tap into a broader pool of resources, driving down the cost per transaction or per inference.","Operational Resilience: The decentralized nature of Ratio1’s platform provides built-in high availability and fault tolerance. Applications orchestrated by Deeploy have no single point of failure – if one node or data center goes offline, the workload is already balanced to another network subfleet or can seamlessly shift to other nodes in the network. This improves uptime and reliability for critical services. Additionally, running workloads closer to end-users (at the edge) can ensure continued operation even if connectivity to a central cloud is lost. For example, an AI service deployed on local edge nodes will keep running and serving users in a region, independent of outages elsewhere - leveraging our partner content delivery network for TLS/balancing using single endpoints. This level of resilience, usually crucial for mission-critical applications (such as healthcare monitoring or industrial control) that cannot afford downtime, is now available for any application and any content creator.","Regulatory Compliance & Data Sovereignty: Deeploy enables a flexible deployment that can help organizations meet compliance requirements and data sovereignty laws. Because the platform can orchestrate containers on specific nodes or geographic regions, companies can choose to keep sensitive data within certain jurisdictions or on approved hardware. For instance, a healthcare provider can ensure patient data is processed on hospital-owned servers or edge devices on-premises, rather than a third-party cloud, helping comply with regulations like HIPAA or GDPR. The blockchain-based audit trail provides transparency and accountability for each job, which adds an extra layer of assurance in regulated industries – every execution and data hand-off can be logged immutably. In short, Ratio1 allows businesses to harness cloud-like convenience while maintaining control over where and how data is handled - stored, processed, communicated.","Ecosystem Alignment & Flexibility: Ratio1’s approach aligns with both modern technology ecosystems and emerging decentralization trends. The orchestration manager itself - Deeploy - is built as part of Ratio1 on open standards (containers, RESTful APIs, and blockchain protocols), so it integrates smoothly with existing tools and platforms. Organizations don’t have to abandon their current ecosystem to use it – Deeploy can complement existing cloud or on-premise systems in a hybrid model. This flexibility means a company can gradually extend workloads to the decentralized network where it makes sense (for cost or latency reasons) while keeping other components in their private cloud or data center. Furthermore, Ratio1 is in tune with the broader Web3 and edge computing movements: it uses blockchain for trust and token based circular economy for incentivizing node operators, aligning with the ethos of decentralized infrastructure. This makes Deeploy attractive to innovators both in traditional web2 as well as in the Web3 space, and it positions client companies to be part of a growing ecosystem of decentralized services. Essentially, adopting Ratio1’s platform can future-proof an organization’s infrastructure strategy, ensuring compatibility with upcoming tech trends and partnerships.","By focusing on these core benefits, Ratio1 appeals to a wide range of privacy-first consumers or forward-looking customers who seek to optimize costs, improve reliability, meet compliance demands, and strategically innovate in their respective markets.","The ideal customers for Ratio1 Deeploy span several industries where censorship protection, true data ownership, distributed computing and edge capabilities can unlock significant value. Below are key sectors and brief scenarios illustrating how Deeploy can be applied in each:","AI/ML Companies and Data Science Platforms: Organizations focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning often require substantial computing power for training models or serving AI-driven applications. Ratio1 offers these companies a way to scale computationally intense tasks across a decentralized grid of GPUs and processors, tapping into idle hardware globally while using Ratio1 R1FS as a secure and trustless decentralized storage network. For instance, an AI startup developing a machine learning model can distribute the training workload to many nodes via Ratio1 Deeploy orchestration management, drastically cutting the time and cost compared to using a single cloud provider’s GPUs. Once models are trained, the same platform can deploy the inference service across edge locations – meaning an AI-driven app (like an image recognition service or a recommendation engine) can run geographically closer to end-users for faster responses. This approach not only reduces cloud bills, but also avoids vendor lock-in, giving AI companies more control over their infrastructure. Moreover, researchers and data scientists can collaborate by sharing a decentralized compute pool while maintaining ownership of their data, since the data can reside sharded and fully encrypted on chosen nodes, enhancing privacy and security for sensitive datasets.","Healthcare and Medical IoT: Hospitals, clinics, and healthcare networks increasingly rely on AI analytics and IoT devices (e.g. for patient monitoring, diagnostic imaging, or personalized medicine). Ratio1’s Deeploy platform can empower healthcare providers to deploy these advanced applications on-site or across regional facilities in a secure and compliant manner. Imagine a scenario where a hospital system uses Ratio1 to deploy and run a containerized AI diagnostic tool that analyzes medical scans. Rather than sending sensitive images to a public cloud, the analysis is orchestrated across secure hospital servers and edge devices at each clinic and or partner locations thus performing a censorship-free and fully confidential data ownership process. This ensures patient data stays within the organization’s controlled environment, fully addressing privacy regulations. The processing is also faster and more reliable, since each facility has the AI service running locally (and will keep running even if the connection to the central system goes down). Additionally, healthcare providers could pool computing resources from multiple hospitals using the Ratio1 blockchain-managed network – allowing them to collectively crunch large datasets for research or predictive modeling, all while maintaining trust and an immutable audit trail for compliance. Deeploy thus helps healthcare organizations adopt cutting-edge AI solutions without compromising on data governance or uptime of critical services.","Smart Manufacturing & Industry 4.0: Manufacturers are increasingly deploying IoT sensors, robotics, and AI-driven quality control systems on the factory floor. These environments demand real-time processing and high reliability, which is where Ratio1’s edge orchestration shines. A factory can run containerized monitoring applications and machine learning models on local edge nodes (such as industrial PCs or control units) managed via Deeploy, ensuring ultra-low latency decisions (for example, immediately detecting a defective product on a production line and stopping the line). In a practical scenario, an automotive manufacturer could use Ratio1 to coordinate predictive maintenance applications across all its plants: each plant’s machines send sensor data to a local Ratio1 node, which runs an AI model to predict equipment failures. Because the computation happens on-site, insights are instant and the system continues to function even if internet connectivity is intermittent. Moreover, headquarters can roll out updates to these models globally through the Deeploy network – scheduling containers to update at each factory in a controlled, decentralized fashion. This leads to greater operational efficiency (less downtime) and consistent performance across geographically dispersed facilities. The decentralized approach also means the solution scales easily as the company adds new factories or partners in their supply chain who can join the network with their own nodes. Important to note is the fact that models can be entirely custom-build and the whole training and inference delivered via containerized apps or it can be done via Ratio1 native application at a dramatically decreased cost in terms of development and maintenance.","Web3 and Decentralized Infrastructure Providers: The Web3 community – spanning blockchain networks, decentralized application (dApp) developers, and crypto infrastructure providers – is an ideal adopter of Ratio1’s platform. Ratio1 Deeploy managed container orchestration approach aligns with the core Web3 principles by providing a computing layer that is decentralized and governed by smart contracts. This is valuable for any decentralized application that needs off-chain computation or microservices. For example, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform might use Ratio1 to run complex risk analysis or machine learning-based fraud detection algorithms across a global network of nodes managed via Deeploy orchestration management, rather than relying on a centralized server. This way, their backend processing is as decentralized as their blockchain-based frontend, enhancing the overall trustworthiness of the system. Likewise, emerging blockchain projects could use Ratio1 to power AI bots, oracle services, or data indexing for their ecosystems, paying node operators with tokens and ensuring no single point of failure. By integrating easily with smart contract logic (through its blockchain connectors), Ratio1 essentially becomes a “decentralized cloud” companion for Web3 ventures. This helps Web3 companies avoid dependence on traditional cloud providers, aligning their tech stack fully with decentralized infrastructure ideals while still achieving high performance and scalability.","Telecommunications (5G & Edge Networks): Telecom operators managing 5G networks and edge sites can use Ratio1’s Deeploy to deploy applications and network functions closer to their subscribers. By orchestrating containers at cell towers, central offices, or regional data centers, telcos can enable new low-latency services (such as AR/VR streaming or real-time gaming) without relying solely on distant cloud data centers. For example, a mobile carrier could use Ratio1 to run a containerized app for content caching service on edge nodes in each city, ensuring videos and updates load faster for local users. This not only improves customer experience through reduced latency, but also offloads traffic from core networks, saving bandwidth costs. The decentralized control is beneficial in telecom environments where infrastructure might be shared or spread across partners – Deeploy orchestration management provides a neutral, secure way to coordinate resources across the network.","Across these industries and scenarios, the common theme is that Ratio1’s platform enables distributed, secure, and efficient development and deployment of applications where traditional centralized solutions or classic software development processes face limitations. Ideal customers are those who operate in distributed environments or have pressing needs for low latency, cost reduction, data control, and innovation at the network’s edge.","To capitalize on its strengths and accelerate adoption in the market, Ratio1 will consider the following strategic actions:","Forge Key Industry Partnerships: Partner with established players in target sectors (e.g. telecom companies, healthcare technology firms, and manufacturing automation providers). Such partnerships can validate Ratio1’s value in real-world settings and create joint solutions. For instance, collaborating with a major telecom on an edge computing pilot or with a medical device company on a hospital deployment will showcase the platform’s capabilities to a wider audience. Strategic alliances will also help Ratio1 tailor its offering to industry-specific requirements and open up customer channels in those verticals.","Demonstrate Compliance and Security Credentials: Given that many ideal customers operate in regulated or sensitive fields, Ratio1 will invest in obtaining relevant certifications and third-party security audits for the Ratio1 overall protocol and for Deeploy platform. This might include compliance standards like ISO/IEC security certifications, GDPR-ready data handling practices, or industry-specific standards (such as HIPAA compliance in healthcare). By proactively addressing regulatory and security concerns, Ratio1 will build trust with potential clients and remove barriers to adoption. Publishing whitepapers or case studies on how the ecosystem ensures data sovereignty, censorship protection and privacy will further reinforce confidence among decision-makers in conservative industries.","Cultivate a Developer & Node Operator Community: Encourage a strong ecosystem of developers and node operators around Deeploy. This can be done by promoting the active participation to the already existing Ratio1 open-source ecosystem, offering comprehensive SDKs/documentation, and hosting hackathons or developer incentive programs. A vibrant developer community will drive innovative use cases on the platform (making it more attractive to clients), while a broad base of node operators will enlarge the network’s capacity and geographic reach. Ratio1 team will engage with Web3 communities and open-source groups to position the Ratio1 ecosystem as the go-to decentralized compute solution, fostering grassroots advocacy and technical contributions that can enhance the platform.","Enhance Integration and Ease of Adoption: To appeal to a broad range of enterprise clients, Ratio1 will ensure Deeploy API is easy to integrate into existing IT environments or easily adopted in new UI/UX apps. This will involve multiple support vectors such ash:","Publishing as Open Source the existing basic Deeploy dApp (UI) so that any developer/partner or Ratio1 Cloud Service Provider can develop their own “OEM” UI;","Further documenting the Deeploy dApp as well as its integration with the Deeploy API;","Building new connectors or plugins for popular enterprise platforms and workflows if required by community","Reducing the friction to try out Deeploy in order to shorten pilot periods;","Providing migration guides, tutorials, as well as direct support from the core team;","Emphasizing that Deeploy complements (rather than replaces) existing infrastructure will help conservative clients see it as a low-risk, high-reward addition to their strategy.","Showcase Success Stories and ROI Metrics: Finally, Ratio1 will collect and publicize success stories that quantify the business impact of using Ratio1 on-edge Cloud and Ratio1 Deeploy. Could be a telecom saving a percentage of bandwidth costs, a factory reducing downtime by hours, or an AI company cutting its cloud bills in half – concrete metrics and testimonials will resonate strongly with both investors and prospective customers. Yet the most critical target remains that of users and creators that focus on data privacy, censorship-less services, “your AI, your Data”, on-edge processing rather than centralized one. Creating case studies and reference accounts in each target industry will provide social proof of the platform’s effectiveness. An additional future target is developing a clear ROI calculator or report for the platform that can help persuade stakeholders (especially CFOs and investors) of the economic advantage of Ratio1’s solution. By consistently highlighting business outcomes – such as cost savings, performance improvements, and risk reduction – Ratio1 will strengthen its positioning as a practical and game-changing solution in the decentralized infrastructure landscape.","Andrei Ionut Damian","Jun 16, 2025","‹ Ratio1.ai: Comprehensive Partnership Strategy and Platform Overview","Introducing Multi Node Launcher (R1setup) - GPU Deployment at Scale Made Simple ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

These CSPs range from DevOps service companies and existing cloud brokers to tech-savvy entrepreneurs, and they use Ratio1 as a cloud-on-edge deployment platform to serve their clients. In parallel, developers themselves can directly use Ratio1 to build and deploy AI or cloud apps. This article focuses on the CSP side – providing a clear business blueprint for how an independent provider can leverage Ratio1’s decentralized infrastructure to deliver value to customers (and even to venture capitalists interested in the model). We will outline how the CSP model works in Ratio1, what the business benefits are, what is required to become a CSP, and how this approach compares to others in the industry.","In essence, Ratio1 enables anyone to become a cloud service provider with minimal barriers – the only fundamental requirement is owning a Ratio1 oracle node license. This opens the door for small companies or individuals to operate as a “lightweight AWS”, offering cloud services without needing massive data centers. The CSP blueprint is about empowering these providers with a franchise-like model: the CSP brings in customers and sets the terms, while the Ratio1 network handles the heavy lifting of distributed AI application deployment.","Understanding the mechanics of Ratio1’s job distribution and reward system (powered by our Proof-of-AI, or PoAI mechanism) is key to the CSP business model. Here is a simplified step-by-step overview of how a CSP engages with the Ratio1 network to deploy client workloads:","Initial Setup (Onboarding) is when the new CSP first onboards into the Ratio1 ecosystem and this involves:","deploying a dedicated PoAI escrow smart contract (owned by the CSP)","setting up an oracle node in the Ratio1 network (the oracle helps monitor and validate jobs).","CSP is also provided with a copy of Deeploy, the Ratio1 deployment dApp, which serves as a management console for submitting and overseeing jobs. (Deeploy’s interface can even be customized by the CSP as their own customer-facing application template.)","Client Engagement & Budgeting is the first step of the recurrent business process. The CSP secures a contract or order from a customer who needs computing resources. For example, it could be:","A small business migrating their containerized app from Azure to save costs while scaling out.","A researcher deploying a Ratio1-native IoT app that gathers sensor data, trains anomaly detection models, and triggers alerts.","A developer launching a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-as-a-Service application using Ratio1’s J33VES framework and templates.","A startup deploying a multi-worker, horizontally scaled AI service with high availability at lower cost.","The client agrees to a budget for the deployment (this might be paid in fiat via contract or invoice). The CSP, per their own commercial policy, will typically add a margin or commission on top of the raw infrastructure cost to ensure profitability. The only aspects that the CSP has to take into consideration are the minimum resource-based proposed fees.","Fuelling the network by funding the Escrow - The CSP then converts the client’s budget (minus the CSP’s commission) into a suitable stablecoin (e.g. USDC) and funds their escrow smart contract with that amount. This is done through the Ratio1 Deeploy app, which ties the budget to the specific job deployment. Essentially, the escrow acts as a pre-paid pool of funds for the upcoming compute work – a guarantee that the node operators will be paid once the work is completed. (The CSP’s commission remains off-chain in fiat or as separately arranged, since Ratio1 does not interfere with how CSPs price their services.)","Decentralized deployment is the next logical stage in the process, thus, once funded, the Ratio1 protocol takes over the technical orchestration. The application workload is distributed to the decentralized Ratio1 Edge Nodes (RENs) across the network. Typically, the system will assign the job to multiple nodes for redundancy – for example, deploying components of the app on 3–4 different nodes to ensure high availability. This is all automatic: the CSP doesn’t have to manually find or negotiate with node operators. The protocol’s scheduling (using round-robin and availability algorithms) finds suitable nodes, and if any node becomes unavailable (e.g., goes offline or has a failure), the workload is seamlessly migrated to another available node. This fault-tolerance provides continuity for the client’s application without CSP intervention. Important to note is that, if the CSP has a preferred set of R1OPs or nodes - such as nodes known to be running in certified datacenters - then the CSP is able to manually “pin” the distributed resources in the target nodes.","The application then runs on the allocated nodes for the predefined duration or number of epochs (an epoch is a short time interval used by Ratio1 to measure uptime and progress). Throughout this period (say, 30 epochs, which might correspond to roughly a month of service in one example), the Ratio1 oracles monitor the nodes. Each node must maintain a required level of uptime and performance. If a node falls below the threshold (for example, it goes down for too long), the system will apply penalties, and its portion of the job can be reassigned to a backup node mid-stream. This ensures the overall application keeps running as promised to the client.","Completion and PAYOUT phase is when the service period is completed successfully and the escrow smart contract is triggered to allocate the funds to all the node operators that contributed. Thanks to Ratio1’s Proof-of-AI consensus, the network can verify that each node indeed delivered the work (using cryptographic proofs from the oracles) before payment is released. Each node operator then claims their earned reward. The payout is made in Ratio1’s native token (R1), with the amount corresponding to the value of their work contribution (proportional to resources provided, time, etc.). Importantly, a 15% fee is deducted and burned by the smart contract as a form of “gas” or ecosystem fee. This means 15% of the escrowed amount is sent to a burn address (removed from circulation), and the remaining ~85% of the budget is paid out to the service providers (the node owners). The burn mechanism benefits the overall token economy by offsetting new token emissions as network usage grows. It’s worth noting that this 15% is not a fee pocketed by any company – it is a decentralized mechanism to support token value, analogous to how some cloud platforms take a cut for infrastructure, except here it’s algorithmically burned for everyone’s long-term benefit.","This entire flow demonstrates how a CSP can plug into Ratio1’s decentralized cloud to offer services similar to a traditional cloud provider. Most of the operational complexity (distributed scheduling, failover, payments, etc.) is handled by Ratio1’s platform, not by the CSP. The Proof-of-AI escrow system guarantees that node operators only get paid for actual work and uptime, giving clients confidence in service reliability without requiring the CSP to maintain physical infrastructure. Ratio1 at core it’s a trustless yet reliable system all parties (client, CSP, node operators) are protected by smart contracts and blockchain transparency and more: all operators are at least KYC-ed.","From a business perspective, the Ratio1 CSP’s involvement is mainly in the upfront and customer-facing parts of the process (steps 1–3 above). After launching a deployment, the network automation takes care of service delivery until completion. This has several implications that make the model attractive:","Customer Ownership","The customers that a CSP brings in remain fully the CSP’s customers. Unlike in a classic cloud resale scenario (where the end customer might know they are on AWS/Azure and could bypass the middleman later), here the CSP is effectively delivering a bespoke service using Ratio1 as the backend. There is no “lock-in” or direct relationship between the customer and some larger cloud vendor. The CSP can brand their services and build customer loyalty, acting truly as the service provider rather than just a reseller.","Pricing Freedom and Margin Control","The CSP has complete autonomy in setting prices for their services. Ratio1’s protocol provides a baseline (the underlying node costs and a recommended minimum to ensure nodes are paid fairly), but above that floor, the CSP can decide how much to charge the client. They could bundle value-added services (like 24/7 support, integration assistance, or custom application development) to justify higher rates. There are also no recurring platform fees charged by the Ratio1 genesis company to the CSP – the protocol’s genesis company does not take a cut of the CSP’s earnings. In fact, aside from the 15% burn which is algorithmically taken from the job escrow for the ecosystem, 0% of the service fee is retained by any central entity for each individual deployed job. This is a key point: the CSP’s profit margin is entirely in their control, and the Ratio1 network itself isn’t taxing their revenue like a typical franchise would. The only “fee” ends up benefiting all stakeholders via token burning (which can improve token value for everyone).","Observation","At present, Ratio1 entirely covers the CSP onboarding package — from deploying your dedicated escrow smart-contract and branded Deeploy console to configuring the oracle node, running compliance checks, and providing full documentation and support. Once the network reaches broader adoption, the community is expected to vote on introducing a modest, fixed monthly maintenance fee, benchmarked against objective usage metrics (e.g., active deployments or escrow throughput) to keep these shared services sustainable over the long term.","Low Operational Overhead","The next key business template key proposition consists in the fact that the CSP does not need to maintain datacenters or physical servers (unless they choose to run their own nodes, which is optional). All the compute power comes from Ratio1’s global network of independent - yet KYC/KYB-ed - node operators. The CSP also doesn’t need to build a complex orchestration platform – they get access to Ratio1’s Deeploy app and other tooling which abstracts away DevOps complexity. In traditional cloud services, a provider would need to manage virtualization, container orchestration, scaling, hardware failures, etc., or at least pay someone to do it. With Ratio1, these are largely handled by the decentralized platform. The CSP’s responsibilities are mainly configuration and customer service. In short, all of the DevOps and infrastructure management is “outsourced” to the Ratio1 protocol. The platform was explicitly designed to allow deployment of full application stacks without the user (or CSP) managing Kubernetes clusters or server fleets.","Scalability and Reliability","Because the network can automatically scale across multiple nodes and replace failing nodes, even a small CSP can offer reliability on par with big cloud providers. Features like built-in load balancing, automatic horizontal scaling (using multiple nodes by default), and geo-distribution come out-of-the-box. For example, a typical web application deployment on Ratio1 might cost half of what it would on AWS, while already including 3-4 node redundancy, high availability, and even CDN-like capabilities through partnerships (e.g., using integrated tunneling for public endpoints). This means a CSP can deliver more value (in performance and uptime) for a lower cost, a strong selling point to win customers from traditional cloud setups.","Ecosystem Benefits","Finally, by operating through Ratio1, the CSP is contributing to a growing ecosystem which in turn can benefit them. The 15% burn of tokens from each job supports the health of the $R1 token economy, potentially increasing the value of any tokens the CSP might earn or hold. Moreover, as more developers and CSPs join, the network effect makes the platform more robust and widely recognized, driving more business to all participants. The CSP can proudly be part of a decentralized cloud movement that emphasizes data ownership, privacy, and community-driven infrastructure – aspects that can differentiate their offering in the market.","To summarize, Ratio1’s CSP blueprint lets you run a cloud service business without the typical burdens of infrastructure capital expenditure and with full control over your customer relationships and pricing. The protocol handles the backend work and enforces quality (nodes only get paid if they perform). All the while, the CSP earns a commission in fiat (or any agreed currency) from clients and could even convert part of their earnings into R1 tokens, aligning with the platform’s growth. It’s a model where the incentives are aligned: CSPs want to bring more workloads, node operators want to run more jobs, clients get cost-effective service, and the Ratio1 network grows organically as a result.","What does a prospective CSP need in order to start operating this business? The requirements are straightforward:","A Legitimate Business Entity","CSPs are expected to be registered businesses or individuals that pass the ecosystem’s KYC/KYB (Know Your Customer/Business) verification. Trust is a crucial factor since CSPs will interface with clients and the network’s financial contracts. Ratio1’s governance model includes accountability measures, so being a verified entity is mandatory to deploy the CSP escrow contracts and to obtain the necessary licenses (this prevents malicious actors from misusing the platform).","Ratio1 Node Deed Licenses","Every participant in the Ratio1 network needs a Node Deed license (which is essentially an NFT-like on-chain license) to operate nodes. A CSP will need to obtain at least two licenses – one of them must be an Oracle Node license (so the CSP can run an oracle node that connects into the network’s consensus and monitoring layer), and the other can be a standard Edge Node license (to potentially run a compute node as part of the network). The oracle node is the key entry requirement; it signals that the CSP is an official part of the network’s backbone. Owning an oracle license often implies holding a Master Node Deed (a special class of license) or a designated CSP license as per Ratio1’s tokenomics. In practical terms, this means an upfront investment – obtaining the license(s) either by purchasing them from the Ratio1 foundation (or the open market if available). These licenses not only grant access but also entitle the operator to mining rewards (for maintaining an oracle or node availability). Aside: if the CSP does not intend to provide any of their own hardware for computation, they might only run the oracle and rely on other node operators for the compute; but many CSPs could choose to also run some nodes to earn extra rewards and ensure capacity for their clients.","Basic Technical Ability (but not too deep)","While one does not need to be a blockchain guru or have a large DevOps team, the CSP should have a reasonable understanding of cloud deployment concepts and be comfortable operating software tools. Ratio1 will provide documentation, support, and a user-friendly interface to guide CSPs. If you can handle deploying a Docker container or managing a small cloud VM, you can likely handle Ratio1 operations. The heavy lifting—such as orchestrating multi-node clusters, ensuring security, and handling failovers—is mostly abstracted away. In short, no special technology expertise beyond typical cloud app management is required. This lowers the barrier so that even a small DevOps consultancy or a startup IT firm can become a CSP with little friction. Ratio1’s goal is to do for cloud infrastructure what WordPress did for web hosting – make it plug-and-play. Our team and community are available to assist new CSPs in setup and troubleshooting, and the ethos is that “if you can drive, you can run this cloud” (i.e., if you understand the basics, the platform will handle the rest).","Commitment to Service Quality","Although much is automated, a CSP should still uphold good business practices. This means setting realistic expectations with clients, periodically monitoring their deployments via the tools provided (aside from automatic Ratio1 monitoring), and responding if any issues arise (for example, if a client’s app needs more resources or an update). The Ratio1 network provides dashboards and alerts, but the CSP is the one who interfaces with the client to ensure they are satisfied. Essentially, the CSP should act as a reliable service provider and first line of support. Also, abiding by Ratio1’s rules (e.g., not attempting to cheat the system) is important – the network has governance mechanisms (including the ability to suspend misbehaving nodes or CSPs, backed by on-chain evidence) to maintain integrity.","If these requirements are met, becoming a CSP is not much harder than becoming, say, an AWS reseller or a managed service provider – except, in this case, you own a piece of the network and have far more flexibility. In fact, Ratio1 is actively seeking to grow the CSP network and offers guidance for new partners to onboard quickly. The model is deliberately “democratized” so that a wide range of participants – from existing small data center operators to cloud consulting firms to individual tech entrepreneurs – can all find a place in the ecosystem.","It’s helpful to put Ratio1’s approach in context by looking at how similar problems are being addressed by others in the cloud industry, both traditional and blockchain-based.","In the conventional cloud market, if a small company wants to become a cloud service provider, they usually have two paths:","Resell services from a big cloud – for example, become an AWS or Azure reseller/partner. This often means you simply pass on AWS’s infrastructure to your clients, maybe with added consulting or support. The downside is that margins can be thin and you have little control. In fact, some analyses have called being an AWS reseller a “horrendous business model” due to the low value-add and reliance on AWS’s terms. You might get a single-digit percentage discount from AWS and have to compete on price and service quality, while the client is ultimately using AWS infrastructure (and could switch if they discover they don’t need you). It’s a tough way to differentiate, and scaling requires significant sales effort.","Build or lease your own infrastructure – essentially start a mini cloud or hosting company. This requires capital expenditures on servers, data center space or leases, and technical expertise to set up virtualization or container platforms. It gives more control than reselling, but it’s capital-intensive and risky if you can’t fill that capacity with paying customers 24/7. Many regional hosting providers exist, but they often struggle to match the economies of scale of hyperscalers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and thus may focus on niche services or local clients. They also face the challenge of needing to provide reliability and features on par with the big players, which is non-trivial for a small operation.","Our CSP model is a bit of a third path. You do not need to build huge infrastructure (the network provides it), and you’re not just reselling a giant’s services (you’re offering something unique – a decentralized cloud with full data ownership, at lower cost). It’s more akin to a franchise model in spirit: Ratio1 provides the platform and the brand, you provide the customer relationships and business savvy. Importantly, you are not bound by the narrow margins and constraints of traditional resell programs – you have freedom to innovate in pricing and services. The protocol’s economic design (token incentives, burning, etc.) aligns with you rather than competing against you.","In recent years, a number of blockchain projects have aimed to create decentralized computing networks. Each has a slightly different focus, but they share the vision of breaking the monopoly of big cloud providers by using blockchain for coordination and payments:","Akash Network (AKT): Often dubbed the “Airbnb for cloud computing,” Akash provides a marketplace where those who need compute (tenants) can find those who have spare capacity (providers). Deployments are described in a manifest, and providers bid on fulfilling them. Smart contracts handle the leasing agreement – ensuring the provider runs the workload and the tenant pays accordingly. Akash claims costs up to 85% lower than traditional clouds by monetizing unused server capacity. The network takes a small fee from transactions (a portion going to Akash token stakers/validators). This approach is quite decentralized: it’s more of a direct P2P market. The challenge for users is that they must interact with a bidding system and manage some crypto details themselves, which can be complex for non-developers.","Golem Network (GLM): Golem started as a decentralized supercomputing project on Ethereum, allowing users to buy or sell computing power globally. Early use-cases included rendering for CGI or heavy computation split across many nodes. Golem effectively creates a peer-to-peer marketplace for excess computing power, where providers earn Golem tokens for completing tasks. It’s an alternative to centralized cloud render farms or compute clusters. Golem’s model is more task-oriented (you submit a job and get results back), and it requires developers to tailor their tasks to the platform. It demonstrated the viability of rewarding contributors for CPU/GPU time via blockchain, paving the way for other projects.","iExec RLC: iExec focuses on decentralized cloud for on-demand computing tasks and has a framework for confidential computing (using secure enclaves) so that enterprise or sensitive computations can run on untrusted nodes safely. Like Golem, it’s marketplace-driven: requesters post tasks, providers execute them, and a consensus or verification mechanism ensures results are valid (through replication or trust mechanisms). iExec also features a decentralized oracle and data marketplace aspect.","Others: There are projects like Render Network (RNDR) which specialize in GPU rendering tasks for the media industry using crypto payments, and CUDOS, Ankr, etc., each with their spin (some focusing on providing decentralized cloud APIs, others on integrating with existing clouds, etc.).","Ratio1 shares the decentralization ethos with the above projects but brings something new with the CSP-centric model and full-stack approach. In Ratio1, the end customer (like an SME and/or developer) doesn’t necessarily have to engage with a crypto marketplace or bidding war – instead, they can go through a CSP who handles the complexity for them.","This lowers the barrier for adoption in traditional industries (they can pay in fiat, have a basic support-contact, and still reap the benefits of decentralized infrastructure). For the CSP and node operators, the blockchain underpinnings (escrow contracts, proof-of-AI, etc.) ensure trust and fairness similar to the other networks mentioned – no one gets paid unless work is done, and everything is transparent. But by structuring it as a franchise business blueprint, Ratio1 effectively blends the concepts: we have the decentralized backend like Golem/Akash, but also a business-facing frontend model where providers can build companies on top of the network.","It’s worth noting that no traditional cloud provider offers an opportunity quite like this. Big Tech clouds don’t let just anyone become a mini-cloud provider under their umbrella with full control; at best you can refer or resell. And among decentralized networks, Ratio1 is unique in explicitly courting Cloud Service Providers as a class of participant (not just individual node runners or developers). We see CSPs as key to reaching a broad customer base, including those who may never know they’re using “decentralized AI cloud” under the hood. This approach could accelerate adoption in enterprise and SME sectors, much like how early web hosting was adopted via agencies and IT consultancies packaging solutions for less tech-savvy clients.","Lastly, important to note is the summarization of resilience and reliability support in Ratio1. Ratio1 sits somewhat in the middle between the Big-Cloud-Native and Web3 decentralized Cloud models. It aspires to AWS-like ease of use and reliability (managed deployment, compliance, support) while utilizing a decentralized network of independent nodes like Golem/Akash. But to reconcile the two, Ratio1 introduces identity and governance from the start. In effect, Ratio1’s compute-providers are more like franchisees or licensed operators rather than random anonymous participants. This is a model we see in some “decentralized” industries: for instance, ride-sharing companies often require driver background checks and can deactivate drivers who don’t meet standards, even though drivers use their own cars. Similarly, Ratio1 requires KYC for node operators and can deactivate those who don’t meet the standards, even though it’s the operators’ own machines doing the work. From a user perspective, Ratio1’s approach provides higher trust in the results. If you deploy an AI model on Ratio1, you might take comfort that nodes are run by known entities who have to invest in a license and won’t risk being banned by tampering with your computation. On Golem, if you deploy an AI task, you might have to build in yourself verification steps because you don’t really know who’s computing your data - it could be many anonymous machines from anywhere.","Ratio1’s CSP business blueprint is an invitation to ride the next wave of cloud computing. It offers a path for businesses and entrepreneurs to participate in the booming demand for AI and edge computing services without needing billions in infrastructure. By leveraging Ratio1’s decentralized network, a CSP can deliver competitive cloud solutions (AI model hosting, data processing, web services, etc.) with compelling advantages: lower costs, built-in scalability, enhanced data ownership, and the agility of a startup. All the while, the CSP is building their own brand and client base, with no onerous fees skimmed off by a platform owner.","For forward-thinking investors (VCs included), this model presents an attractive proposition as well. It taps into what industry specialists predict to be a multi-trillion dollar market opportunity in decentralized cloud services – essentially the “long tail” of cloud demand that hyperscalers can’t or won’t serve, especially regarding data privacy and edge deployments. Ratio1 is creating an ecosystem where value is distributed to those who actually run and support the network (node operators, CSPs, developers), rather than being centralized. The burn mechanism and token-based economy align incentives so that as usage increases, the ecosystem’s health strengthens. In other words, growth directly benefits all stakeholders.","In conclusion, whether you are an existing cloud provider looking to expand your offerings, a DevOps team seeking a new revenue stream, or an entrepreneur eyeing the cloud market, Ratio1 provides a ready-made blueprint to become a decentralized cloud service provider. It combines the commercial soundness of a franchise-like business (you earn from clients, set your policies, and build a recurring revenue stream) with the technological rigor of a blockchain-powered platform (trustless execution, transparency, and global scalability). The CSP business blueprint is our way of saying “join us in building the Uber of cloud computing” – a network where anyone can contribute and profit, and where AI and cloud services are truly democratized.","The future of cloud isn’t monopolized data centers; it’s a vibrant, distributed marketplace where your AI, your data, your cloud comes to life on your terms.","Andrei Ionut Damian","Jun 26, 2025","‹ Permissionless vs Trustless: An Analysis of Ratio1's Approach to Decentralized AI Computing","Mastering Edge Node Launcher: A Step-by-Step Tutorial ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

These concepts, while often conflated, represent distinct architectural and philosophical approaches to distributed systems that have profound implications for network security, user autonomy, and regulatory compliance.","Permissionless systems allow anyone to participate in a network without requiring authorization or approval from a central authority (1)(2). In blockchain contexts, this means anyone with appropriate hardware and software can join the network, validate transactions, and contribute to consensus mechanisms (3)(4). Bitcoin and Ethereum exemplify permissionless networks where participants need no credentials or approval to mine blocks or run nodes (2).","Trustless systems, conversely, operate without requiring participants to trust each other or a central intermediary (5)(6). Trust is distributed across the network through cryptographic protocols and consensus mechanisms, eliminating single points of failure (7)(8). As one expert notes, \"trustless\" doesn't eliminate trust entirely but rather \"minimizes the amount of trust required and distributes it across a network of people\" (5).","Ratio1 occupies a fascinating middle ground between these paradigms, implementing what could be termed a permissioned-trustless model. The platform requires Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and license ownership (Node Deeds) for participation, making it decidedly not permissionless (9). However, once participants are onboarded, the system operates with distributed consensus mechanisms (Proof of Availability and Proof of AI) that minimize reliance on centralized authorities for ongoing operations (9).","This design choice reflects what the blogpost describes as prioritizing \"governance and compliance to make the network reliable and legally viable\" (9). Unlike purely permissionless networks such as Golem Network, where \"anyone can install the Golem node and start offering resources\" without KYC requirements (9), Ratio1 explicitly opts for identity verification as a prerequisite for participation.","Golem represents the permissionless ideal, allowing anyone to contribute computing resources without identity verification (10)(11). The network relies on sandboxing and reputation systems rather than upfront screening (9). However, this approach introduces challenges: as the Golem team acknowledged, \"without adding something like KYC or a robust verification consensus, there will always be ways to try to game the system\" (9).","Akash operates as a \"permissionless\" marketplace where providers can participate by staking tokens without explicit KYC (12)(13). However, the staking requirement and escrow mechanisms introduce economic barriers that, while not requiring identity verification, still gate participation based on economic commitment (9).","AWS, Google Cloud, and other centralized providers represent the opposite extreme: fully permissioned systems requiring detailed user verification and contractual agreements (9). These systems are decidedly not trustless, as users must trust the provider's policies, security, and continued service availability.","Ratio1's approach reveals that permissionlessness and trustlessness exist on separate axes, creating four potential quadrants:","Permissionless + Trustless: Pure blockchain networks like Bitcoin","Permissioned + Trustless: Ratio1's model with KYC but distributed consensus","Permissionless + Trusted: Open networks requiring trust in central authorities","Permissioned + Trusted: Traditional cloud services and enterprise systems","The tension between these concepts becomes particularly acute when considering regulatory compliance and security requirements. Decentralized KYC systems are emerging as potential solutions, using blockchain technology to verify identities while maintaining distributed trust (14)(15). These systems could theoretically allow networks to be both permissionless (no ongoing central control) and compliant (initial identity verification) (16).","However, Ratio1's approach suggests that for enterprise and consumer applications handling sensitive data, pure permissionlessness may be impractical. The blogpost notes that \"the majority of the market requires clear data governance, reliability and strong operational resilience\" (9). This business reality drives the compromise toward permissioned entry with trustless operation.","The debate reflects deeper questions about the nature of decentralization itself. Pure permissionless advocates argue that any entry barriers compromise the fundamental promise of decentralization (17). Pragmatic implementers like Ratio1 contend that some centralized elements are necessary for real-world adoption and regulatory acceptance (18).","The blogpost frames this as Ratio1's \"compute providers are more like franchisees or licensed operators rather than random anonymous participants\" (9). This franchise model maintains distributed operation while ensuring baseline standards and accountability.","As decentralized AI platforms continue to evolve in 2025, the tension between permissionlessness and trustlessness will likely drive further innovation (19)(20). Emerging technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols, and sophisticated consensus mechanisms may eventually enable systems that are both fully permissionless and trustless while meeting regulatory requirements (21)(22).","However, Ratio1's approach suggests that for the foreseeable future, successful decentralized computing platforms may need to make strategic compromises, prioritizing trustless operation over permissionless entry to achieve practical deployment and regulatory acceptance. This represents not a failure of decentralized ideals, but rather their pragmatic evolution to address real-world constraints and requirements.","The Ratio1 case study ultimately demonstrates that the binary framing of \"centralized vs. decentralized\" oversimplifies the nuanced architectural choices required for building practical, scalable, and compliant distributed systems. The future of decentralized computing may well lie in these thoughtful compromises between ideological purity and practical necessity.","Petrica Butusina","Jun 30, 2025","‹ Deep Dive into the Ratio1 Community Telegram Bot: network insights, for everyone","The CSP Business Blueprint ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

Our new Ratio1 Telegram Bot - built on the Ratio1 tech stack - aims to make it easier for everyone by delivering important network updates and node health alerts right where many of you already chat: on Telegram. Whether you’re a community member tracking the network’s growth or a node runner keeping an eye on your hardware, this bot has you covered.","In this post we’ll explain what the bot does and dissect its codebase and design choices. This implementation is really a springboard for almost any Telegram-based watchdog you can imagine. Because it already handles the heavy lifting - setting up a Ratio1 pipeline, talking to Telegram, querying on-chain data, caching state, and persisting it to disk - you can swap in a different data-fetch routine and instantly build other bots. Think wallet-transaction trackers that ping on high-value transfers, scam-token sentinels flagging sudden rug-pull patterns (analysed by AI), gas-spike alerts, NFT floor-price monitors, and more. Treat this bot as a live template for a whole toolbox of bots you can build.","What does the Ratio1 Bot do?","At a high level, it has two key functions:","📆 Automated Epoch Summaries: At the end of each epoch, the bot posts a concise summary of network stats to the public Ratio1 Telegram group. This summary includes metrics like the number of active nodes, total licenses, circulating R1 supply, rewards from the last epoch, and tokens burned. It’s a quick way for everyone to see how the network performed in the latest epoch and how it evolves day by day - no manual queries or block explorer digging needed.","⚠️ Node Offline Alerts: If you operate Ratio1 nodes, you can subscribe to offline notifications. Simply send the bot a /watch <YourWalletAddress> command (in a direct chat with the bot), and it will monitor all nodes tied to that wallet. If any of your nodes go offline, the bot immediately sends you a private alert. When the node comes back online, you’ll get a “back online” message as well. You can manage your watch list with commands like /watchlist, /unwatch <wallet> or even /unwatchall to clear the list. No more finding out hours later that your node was down – the bot will ping you in real time.","How to use it?","To see the epoch summaries, just join our official Telegram community chat where the bot posts updates at every epoch change. For node alerts, start a conversation with the Ratio1 bot (https://t.me/Ratio1ai_bot) and use the /watch command as described. In short, anyone can follow network progress in the group, and node operators can get peace of mind through instant outage notifications.","What’s under the hood?","Next, we’ll shift gears and explore how this bot is built and how it leverages the Ratio1 technology to make it easier for anyone to develop their own bot. While this part is mainly for developers, you might still be interested in finding out how easy it is to develop bots on Ratio1, and you might find yourself interested in vibe-coding your next idea, without having all the overhead from complex DevOps preparations, libraries handling and so on.","Behind the scenes, the Ratio1 Telegram Bot is powered by a Ratio1 pipeline, which leverages the already existing Telegram Bot plugin. Thanks to this architecture, the entire bot is implemented in a clean, concise way - no need to set up servers, complex cron jobs, webhooks.","The entire bot creation and handling is done in a few lines of code, allowing developers to focus on what really matters for their app. We’ll break down some key code snippets of the bot’s code to show how it works, but you can find the full code at https://github.com/Ratio1/ratio1_sdk/blob/main/tutorials/ex21_telegram_community_bot.py. For a more detailed description of the basics of deploying a Telegram bot, you can read more in our previous blogpost “Deploying Telegram bots on Ratio1: from naive Echo-bot to a serious Blackjack-dealer” (https://ratio1.ai/blog/deploying-telegram-bots-on-ratio1) - we’ll build on that foundation here without repeating some of the basics.","In Ratio1, your code runs inside a pipeline - essentially a containerized agent that executes on an Edge Node in the network. The Ratio1 SDK makes it extremely easy to deploy a Telegram bot pipeline. In fact, you can do it in just a few lines of code. We start by creating a session and instructing it to use our target node (by address). Then we call the handy create_telegram_simple_bot method, which sets up a Telegram bot pipeline with the given token and handlers in one go. Finally, we deploy the pipeline to actually run it on the node. Here’s what that looks like in code:","As you can see, all the boilerplate is handled for us. We didn’t have to write any low-level Telegram polling logic or web server - Ratio1’s SDK created a bot instance connected to Telegram and tied it into our custom logic. We provided two callbacks here: message_handler=reply for processing incoming user commands, and processing_handler=loop_processing for continuous background tasks. Let’s explore those next.","One of the bot’s jobs is to keep an eye on the Ratio1 network and summarize each epoch. We achieve this using Ratio1’s Network Monitor plugin (plugin.netmon), which gives our code easy access to the network's data. Inside the loop_processing function (which runs continuously in the background), the bot does roughly the following:","Get the latest epoch: Using the network monitor’s epoch manager, the bot fetches the current epoch number with a single call: last_epoch = plugin.netmon.epoch_manager.get_last_sync_epoch() . This tells the bot which epoch just completed and got synced between all the oracles.","Gather node statistics: The bot retrieves the list of all active nodes from the monitor (plugin.netmon.available_nodes_prefixed). It even breaks them down by type (ND, MND, GND licenses) and calculates the total ND mining rewards for the epoch by checking on-chain data for each node’s contribution. All of this is done with straightforward calls like plugin.bc.get_node_license_info(...) to fetch a node’s license type and assigned rewards, and plugin.netmon.network_node_is_online(...) to check if a node is currently online. No complex web3 code is needed – the Ratio1 plugin provides high-level methods for these common tasks.","Detect offline/online nodes: Still in the background loop, the bot checks each watched wallet (those that users subscribed via /watch) and looks up all node addresses under that wallet (plugin.bc.get_wallet_nodes(...)). For each node, it uses the network monitor to see if the node is online. If a node that was previously online goes offline, or vice versa, the bot immediately sends the user an alert message with the node’s alias and address. This logic ensures that node operators get timely notifications about status changes without any manual intervention.","Crucially, the plugin system allows us to do all the above in a few lines of Python, without dealing with raw RPC calls or external monitoring scripts.","The Ratio1 bot doesn’t only rely on local node data; it also pulls in additional info via HTTP requests and blockchain queries - all integrated into the plugin environment. This serves as a great example of how you can fetch data from multiple sources for your logic. For example, to populate the epoch summary, the bot needs token supply and burn statistics. Rather than running a separate script or calling a blockchain RPC manually, our code simply uses Ratio1’s built-in request module:","In the snippet above, the bot uses plugin.requests.get(...) to call Ratio1’s public API for the latest R1 token metrics (circulating supply, total supply, and how much R1 has been burned so far). It also defines a helper to perform an EVM query via plugin.requests.post to an Ethereum RPC URL, in order to get the total supply of ND and MND license NFTs on Base. All these HTTP and blockchain queries are done with standard Python requests semantics - the Ratio1 environment allows them safely, so our bot can easily mix on-chain data with off-chain API data.","To make the bot efficient and stateful, we take advantage of Ratio1’s caching system. The bot needs to remember some information between iterations of the loop and even across restarts of the pipeline. For example, it keeps track of which epoch summaries have already been sent (so it doesn’t repeat work for the same epoch) and which nodes have already triggered an offline alert (so it won’t spam you repeatedly for the same outage). It also needs to remember the list of wallets each user is watching for offline alerts.","Ratio1 plugins provide an in-memory object cache (plugin.obj_cache) for storing arbitrary Python objects across function calls. We use this to hold dictionaries of past epoch data and watched wallets. Additionally, Ratio1 offers a persistent storage API (plugin.diskapi) which allows saving data simply and safely, so that it can be reloaded even if the pipeline stops and restarts later. Here’s how we utilize these features in the bot code:","With a few simple lines of code, we ensure that the bot never loses its memory, ensuring at the same time a simple developer experience to save and load data from storage and cache, and full safety for node operators (no dangerous operation can be done using this system)","Last but not least, we’ll showcase how to handle received messages, and how to send them.","As you have seen, we had two parameters for the create_telegram_simple_bot function: message_handler and processing_handler.","In processing_handler, where we are monitoring nodes and epoch change, we want to send messages without an immediate previous interaction from the user. This is achieved with with a few very simple lines of code:","And that’s it! It’s enough for you to know the user_id, prepare the message text, and send it with one line of code!","On the other hand, when a user sends a message to your bot, the reply function will be called, giving you as a parameter all the information you need: the message, the user who sent it, and the chat where the message was sent.","And replying to it is as easy as a return statement:","return \"Welcome to the Ratio1 Bot! Use /watch <wallet_address> to start watching your nodes. You will receive notifications when your nodes are offline.\"","Building this Telegram bot was a powerful demonstration of how Ratio1 is able to retrieve data from multiple sources and simplifies the development of any kind of application. In under a few hundred lines of code, we created a bot that taps into on-chain data, calls external APIs, maintains state, and interacts with users - all while running on a trustless, distributed network of nodes. The concise code is made possible by Ratio1’s plugin system, which provides high-level tools out of the box (from network monitors to caching and Telegram integration).","For developers, the take-away is clear: Ratio1 makes it easy to build bots and agents that are not only scalable and secure, but also easy to write and maintain. You focus on your bot’s logic, and Ratio1 handles the heavy lifting of deployment, scaling, and connectivity. If a simple network-monitoring bot can be this straightforward, imagine what else you can create - from AI-powered chatbots to automated on-chain traders or decentralized assistants.","We encourage you to explore the simplicity and flexibility of Ratio1 for your own projects. Check out our docs and other tutorials, grab the SDK, and start coding. Whether it’s another Telegram bot or any decentralized application, Ratio1’s platform is designed to let your creativity run wild without worrying about the infrastructure.

From day one, we built Ratio1 - a decentralized AI meta-OS - with a developer-first mindset. Here are 6 key takeaways we embraced (inspired by Michael Skok’s classic lecture, originally introduced at Harvard Innovation Labs and still available online.) to ensure Ratio1 is something people actually need - not just something new.","We didn’t begin by pitching “a cool blockchain AI platform.” Instead, we started by identifying three major pain points our target users faced, and we defined the problem in those concrete terms. First, development is costly and complex - even with modern tools (e.g. OpenAI’s Codex), building sophisticated ML solutions demands significant time, expertise, and budget. Second, deploying and managing AI (DevOps/MLOps) is notoriously difficult and resource-intensive for small teams. Third, cloud infrastructure is prohibitively expensive and comes with vendor lock-in. In other words, current AI deployment is too costly, too centralized, and too difficult without specialized expertise. Ratio1 was conceived entirely around solving these pains, not showcasing technology for its own sake. Yes, our idea involved a decentralized “AI cloud” of idle devices (a DePIN cloud-on-edge) to cut costs - but that’s just one pillar. We also built Ratio1 as a permissioned, resilient network (so it can serve applications needing reliable, compliant hosting) and focused on a developer-friendly experience (offering plug-and-play tools and SDKs so you can use our platform in your own language or container with minimal friction). In short, we let the problem guide the idea. Everything in Ratio1 - from leveraging distributed edge compute to enforcing trust/compliance and simplifying AI app development - was shaped by real user pain points, not by chasing buzzwords.","We made sure our target problem checked the right boxes before diving in. In our case, the pain is undeniably Unworkable if left unsolved (many teams simply cannot deploy AI at scale under today’s costs and constraints). It’s Unavoidable as AI adoption grows - demand for compute is exploding, whether we like it or not, and those limitations will hit everyone. The problem is clearly Underserved by current solutions. In fact, existing platforms either force you into expensive vendor lock-in or lack key features for AI workflows, leaving smaller players in the lurch. That told us this wasn’t a mere inconvenience - it was a glaring gap in the market. And the Urgency was real: if we don’t solve this now, countless AI innovations in startups and under-resourced communities might never see the light of day. Ratio1’s mission hits multiple “U’s,” which gave us confidence that we’re working on something truly valuable (not just a nice-to-have).","Before writing a single line of code, we spoke to AI developers, data scientists, and startup founders about their pain points. We asked things like: “What’s your #1 headache in deploying AI right now?” The answers we heard - budget-busting cloud bills, ops complexity, data privacy concerns - directly guided our design. This user-first approach kept us from getting lost in our own tech bubble. We weren’t trying to sell people on a fancy decentralized OS for its own sake; we were validating that our solution matched their needs. Those early conversations confirmed the struggle was real (our team’s own background in AI/DevOps told us that, but user validation was key). We only started building after we understood exactly what they needed. In short, we pitched Ratio1 in terms of user priorities (cost, ease, trust), not just tech jargon. By talking to users instead of talking up our technology, we ensured we were crafting a solution to their problem, not ours.","There’s a big difference between a latent pain and a critical pain. We aimed squarely at a mission-critical need: accessible and scalable AI infrastructure for those who currently can’t get it. For our users, this isn’t some “would be cool to have” feature - it’s often the make-or-break factor for their projects. If an AI startup can’t afford to train models, or if a company can’t deploy an AI service without risking outages or bankruptcy from cloud costs, that’s a serious problem. We knew Ratio1 had to solve a gut-level pain: the inability to harness AI due to cost or complexity. By enabling distributed compute at lower cost (and doing so in a way that maintains reliability and compliance), we’re helping prevent “outage-level” catastrophes for these teams. For example, not being able to serve users or iterate on a model because of infrastructure limitations is akin to downtime for a business. The litmus test we used was: does the user feel this problem deeply on a day-to-day basis? In our case, yes - teams feel the burn of cloud expenses, dev bottlenecks, and scaling headaches every single day. That told us the need we’re addressing is critical, not just a nice extra. It kept us focused on building core solutions, not fluff.","Incremental improvements weren’t enough; we set out to be discontinuous and truly disruptive. Ratio1 isn’t just a slightly cheaper or faster compute platform - it’s a fundamentally new model of deploying AI. We combine blockchain and edge computing to do something that wasn’t possible before. In fact, Ratio1’s architecture turns idle devices (laptops, phones, even cloud VMs) into a trustless global supercomputer. That means anyone can contribute or utilize AI compute across a decentralized network with built-in trust and transparency. Importantly, the network’s permissioned design (nodes are licensed and vetted) adds a layer of reliability that typical “cloud-on-edge” platforms can’t offer. This isn’t just a 2× better solution, it’s a different paradigm altogether. By integrating features like on-chain coordination, decentralized storage, and even homomorphic encryption for data privacy, we created a platform that’s hard to duplicate. We’ve also woven in developer-centric innovations (like native Ratio1 SDKs and low-code tools) that other solutions lack, making our ecosystem even more robust. The defensibility comes from this breadth of innovation and the network effects of our community - nodes, developers, and data providers all reinforce each other in the ecosystem. Bottom line: we aimed for a product that changes the game, not one that just competes on minor improvements.","We know developers and companies won’t switch to a new platform unless the benefits overwhelmingly outweigh the effort. So we designed Ratio1 to offer a massive gain with minimal friction. How? For one, the cost savings and access to new compute sources can be dramatic - imagine running your ML tasks on hundreds of idle devices around the world for a fraction of the cost of a single cloud VM. Also, Ratio1 gives you capabilities (like built-in peer-to-peer orchestration, on-demand scaling, and integrated compliance) that you simply can’t get in traditional clouds without huge effort. At the same time, we worked hard to lower the switching pain: our tools feel familiar (a developer can deploy a container or AI model to Ratio1 with a one-liner, much like deploying to Docker or Kubernetes). The platform abstracts away complexity with low-code interfaces and automation, so onboarding is quick and easy - you can stand up an AI microservice in minutes instead of wrestling with weeks of DevOps setup. We also ensure data stays encrypted and nodes are vetted (KYC’d), which eases trust and legal concerns for businesses. All this means the benefit of using Ratio1 - faster go-to-market, orders-of-magnitude cost reduction, new revenue streams for node operators - vastly exceeds the cost (learning a new system or trusting a new network). We set a high bar for ourselves: if we couldn’t offer roughly a 10× improvement, we knew we still had work to do.","By following these six principles, we’ve grounded Ratio1 in solving a real, urgent problem with an innovative solution. It’s not about blockchain, or AI, or edge compute in isolation - it’s about delivering tangible value to users. As we continue to build and evolve, these takeaways serve as our North Star to make sure we stay aligned with what users truly need. In the end, the goal is that when people discover Ratio1, their reaction isn’t “Oh, cool tech.” It’s “Yes - this is exactly the solution to the problem I’ve been facing!” That’s when you know you’re building a product people will actually buy into. And that’s the philosophy driving Ratio1’s journey from a bold idea to a game-changing reality.","Petrica Butusina","Jul 12, 2025","‹ Decentralized Cloud Computing and Beyond","Ratio1 Secures Community Trust Through 12-Month Liquidity Lock ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

Instead of \"renting VMs\" or \"deploying containers\" or \"using automated CI/CD\" from hyperscalers, Ratio1 provides a decentralized managed platform that handles the entire application lifecycle - akin to a Kubernetes-like PaaS built on blockchain. Here the developer never \"worries about infrastructure\" nor about (Deep) Machine Learning operations complexities; they just deploy containers or AI model pipelines and the protocol handles scaling, networking, storage and much more. In Ratio1’s model, data stays under the user’s control (on privately operated nodes), not sitting in someone else’s data center, which preserves data sovereignty and privacy. In short, Ratio1 is \"Kubernetes-plus\": it loves Kubernetes principles, but extends them into a trustless, decentralized environment with many advanced built-in services.","Ratio1’s platform goes far beyond raw infrastructure or a simple app-creation-automation tool. Under the hood it’s a fully managed container orchestration system (like decentralized Kubernetes) that includes enterprise-grade services by default. Key components include:","R1FS (Decentralized Storage) consists of a global, IPFS-based file system that shards and encrypts data across nodes. R1FS ensures secure, fault-tolerant storage so apps have encrypted persistent storage without relying on a central data center.","CSTORE (In-Memory DB) is a distributed key-value database (based on the ChainStore) integrated into the platform. This \"Redis-like\" service runs in memory across nodes, eliminating the need to provision separate database instances for caching or session state. All containers in a deployment can share data instantly via CSTORE.","Built-in Secure Networking enables every service endpoint on Ratio1 to automatically get an HTTPS/TLS tunnel by default (akin to integrated DNS/SSL). In practice, developers don’t have to manage certificates or load balancers; the platform transparently provides encrypted service tunnels. For example, Deeploy (Ratio1’s deployment app) can expose microservices to the public internet securely out-of-the-box.","Native AI Support: The platform is optimized for both cloud-native apps and AI workloads. You can deploy arbitrary containers or use even more powerful features such as developing your own neuro-symbolic system, bringing your own AI models or just building a \"simple\" IoT end-to-end application and Ratio1’s scheduler treats them similarly. (In fact, their J33VES framework explicitly combines containers with LLMs over R1FS for code and data including RAG-as-a-Service.) Resource scheduling and GPU assignments are built into the system so that ML/AI jobs run efficiently without extra plumbing. As one of Ratio1 blog notes, Ratio1 lets you \"launch AI microservices, fully load-balanced, scalable, and ready to use, without ever having to worry about infrastructure\".","In essence, Ratio1 provides \"decentralized Kubernetes with enterprise and end-to-end development features built-in.\" Developers simply declare their container images and resource needs; the network’s smart contracts and oracles then orchestrate the containers across multiple nodes with high availability and security. All of this happens with no separate setup of databases, certificates, or storage systems - those are just part of the platform.","Ratio1’s Cloud Service Provider (CSP) model is novel. Instead of reselling central cloud offerings, CSPs deploy their own branded services on top of the Ratio1 network, handling customers directly. Key advantages include full customer ownership, total margin freedom, operational simplicity and more:","Full Customer Control: CSPs retain their customer relationships and branding. They aren’t \"middlemen\" with hidden hyperscaler services; they become true providers offering their own cloud portal. (This means clients stay loyal - Ratio1 doesn’t steal them.) As the whitepaper explains, CSPs enjoy a \"franchise-like model\" where CSPs bring in customers and set terms, while the Ratio1 network handles the heavy lifting.","Pricing Freedom: CSPs set all retail prices above a baseline cost. Ratio1’s protocol specifies only a minimum node cost (to fairly compensate operators), and CSPs add their own margin. Crucially, Ratio1 itself takes 0% profit on services; aside from a built-in 15% \"protocol gas fee burn\" from every job, all revenue beyond the floor goes to the CSP and node operators. In other words, CSPs aren’t forced into fixed margins or expensive vendor fees - they capture the upside.","Operational Simplicity: CSPs do not need their own data centers or cluster infrastructure. The entire backend is managed by Ratio1’s protocol. The CSP simply uses the Deeploy console (fully customizable/white-label) to configure deployments. Behind the scenes, the decentralized scheduler automatically handles container placement, load balancing, and failover. As one source notes, \"Most of the operational complexity (distributed scheduling, failover, payments, etc.) is handled by Ratio1’s platform, not by the CSP\". This means a small team can run a \"lightweight AWS\" without hiring DevOps: the network does the DevOps.","Built-in Scalability & High Availability: By default, every deployment is multi-node and fault-tolerant. Ratio1 automatically launches redundant replicas on different nodes for each app. If demand grows, the system can spin up extra containers seamlessly; if a node fails, others instantly take over. The platform’s \"extreme high-availability horizontal scaling\" means even a small CSP can match the reliability of big clouds. (Moreover, adding replicas is cost-efficient - the first extra copy only adds about 50% to the base cost, encouraging multi-instance deployment.)","Transparent Incentives: All payments run through on-chain escrow smart contracts. A CSP funds an escrow in stablecoin for each job, and only when the network’s oracles cryptographically confirm job completion is the escrow paid out. Nodes are paid only for the work they actually perform. Importantly, 15% of each job’s value is algorithmically burned (deflationary \"gas\") and ~85% goes to node operators. This burn helps stabilize the R1 token economy - it’s a built-in incentive alignment akin to cloud \"hosting fees,\" but fully transparent and non-profit.","To sum it all up, the CSP model lets anyone with a node license and some basic IT skills start their business as a cloud provider. The CSP handles sales/support, and Ratio1 handles the rest. There is no vendor lock-in: CSPs run on decentralized infrastructure, keep all earnings above costs, and even benefit as the network grows (the token’s value is bolstered by the 15% burns).","Important to note, every node operator and CSP is KYC/KYB-verified, ensuring trust: unreliable operators can be identified and removed, which means clients have transparency over who’s running their workloads.","Ratio1 published baseline pricing (Link) schedule defines the minimum payments to node operators (so they’re fairly compensated). CSPs are free to charge customers above this floor. In practice, this means raw resource costs are very low. For example, Ratio1’s pricing page shows a 1-vCPU/2GB compute instance at only about $11.25/month, and even a beefy 24-core/128GB node at $375/month (for the base two-replica deployment). Managed database services (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) start around $30/month for small configs - far below typical cloud DB prices. Specialized GPU offerings are also very competitive: low-end RTX 2060/3070 cards start at roughly $36/month, while high-end A100/H100 instances are about $900/month.","Critically, these prices already include high-availability features. By default Ratio1 launches at least two replicas of any service, so HA is built in. And additional replicas scale in cost: each extra instance adds only ~50% of the base price. This \"horizontal scaling discount\" makes it very inexpensive to improve redundancy or performance. In effect, a web app deployed on Ratio1 might automatically cost a bit more than the base price (for two nodes) but still remain a fraction of what a single-machine setup on AWS would cost with similar HA.","Note: For context, on traditional clouds a small Kubernetes node can easily cost $50-100+/month on its own. For example, Google Cloud’s 3×e2-standard-4 cluster (3 nodes, 4 vCPU/16GB each) plus management fees is on the order of $370/mo. AWS and Azure are similar. In contrast, Ratio1’s equivalent (with 2+ replicas by default) can be up to 70-80% cheaper. All told, including what most cloud providers charge extra for load balancers (about $18-24/mo), database services ($100+/mo), and SSL management, a full production stack on Ratio1 can be dramatically lower-cost. Ratio1 essentially bundles these features for free.","Against traditional cloud-managed Kubernetes or container services, Ratio1 stands out on both price and functionality:","Control Plane / Cluster Fee: AWS EKS, GKE and similar services charge $0.10 per cluster-hour ($73/month) just for orchestration. Ratio1 includes orchestration at no extra cost - there is no recurring \"cluster management\" fee beyond the baseline node rates.","Basic Compute: Running a small node (2 vCPU, 4 GB) on AWS or GCP typically costs $50-100+ per month even before adding redundancy. (For example, CloudChipr shows three 4‑vCPU,16 GB GCP nodes plus one cluster costing ≈$369/mo.) In contrast, Ratio1’s 1‑vCPU/2 GB instance is only about $11.25/mo and with two nodes by default for HA it is all a mere fraction of the cloud cost.","Managed Databases: A basic managed PostgreSQL or MySQL instance on public clouds often exceeds $100/mo for minimal size. Ratio1 offers built-in managed databases starting around $30/mo for small configs, and soon will be including HA replicas.","GPU Instances: Cloud GPU servers are very expensive. For example, AWS’s P4d (8×A100) instance is $32.77/hour (over $23,000/month) - and even a smaller GPU like a V100 runs many hundreds per month. By contrast, Ratio1’s GPU offerings start at $36/month for an RTX-based card and rise to about $900/month for a top-of-line GPU (including the blockchain-based orchestration overhead).","Additional Services: Most cloud providers charge extra for basic services. An AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) running 24/7 costs on the order of $24/month. SSL certificates, disaster recovery, backups, etc. also incur fees. Ratio1’s platform includes many of these out of the box: TLS tunnels, distributed load balancing, encrypted storage (R1FS), in-memory database (CSTORE), automatic failover, etc. In practice this means a fully-featured PaaS on Ratio1 can be 50-70% cheaper than an equivalent AWS/GCP/Azure setup with HA and enterprise features.","In summary, Ratio1’s pricing is very competitive, because it starts from a minimal node cost and layers on automatic HA and features. Traditional clouds typically add cost after basic compute - whereas Ratio1 bundles those into the base price and then even discounts additional replicas.","Ratio1’s decentralized platform is underpinned by blockchain-based economics and governance:","Proof-of-AI & Escrow: All jobs run through smart contracts. A CSP funds a job’s escrow (in stablecoin), then Ratio1’s Proof-of-AI mechanism assigns the work to nodes. Only when on-chain oracles verify successful execution do the contracts release payment (rewards claiming). This trustless model guarantees nodes are paid only for real work (no \"pay-per-minute\" scams).","15% Token Burn: By design, 15% of every job’s payment is automatically burned (removed from supply) when the escrow is paid out. The remaining ~85% is distributed to the contributing node operators. This \"ecosystem gas fee\" burn helps offset inflation and aligns incentives for token holders. IMPORTANT: It is not a fee to the company; it’s a deflationary mechanism for the R1 token.","Utility Token: The native R1 token is purely for platform utility. Developers and CSPs use R1 tokens to access services: for example, to pay for GPU credits, job fees, storage, or license unlocks. Unlike speculative crypto, R1 is explicitly used for these operational transactions only.","Node Operator Network: The computational backbone is a distributed network of independent node operators. All operators (and CSPs) must pass KYC/KYB verification, which means the platform knows who is running each node.","The Permissioned paradigm: This is unlike completely anonymous schemes - if an operator misbehaves (low uptime, malicious behavior), Ratio1’s governance can blacklist them and based on KYC/KYB they can be held liable for potential serious situations. Thus users enjoy transparency and accountability: each node’s identity and performance are on-chain. Nodes are rewarded per their contributions (CPU, memory, GPU time, uptime), which strongly incentivizes reliability.","Ratio1 also emphasizes both privacy and compliance in the same time. User data is end-to-end encrypted (keys held by the user), and the system is built to meet data-sovereignty and regulatory requirements. For example, an enterprise can run nodes on-premises and still participate in the Ratio1 network. In one use-case, a hospital could host its own nodes to ensure patient data never leaves the facility. Meanwhile, the blockchain-based audit trails provide full transparency and GDPR-friendly operations - everything that happens (payments, node deeds, governance votes, etc.) is immutably recorded.","Ratio1 is well-suited to several scenarios:","Enterprise Cloud Migration: Companies burdened by rising AWS/Azure bills (and complex setups) can containerize existing apps and move them to Ratio1. For example, a small business migrating from Azure to cut costs is a typical scenario. They gain similar or better reliability (because of default multi-node HA) at a fraction of the cost. Industries with strict compliance (healthcare, finance, government) benefit from built-in encryption and data-sovereignty options.","AI/ML Workloads: Organizations running machine learning models or serving AI APIs can exploit Ratio1’s native GPU support and optimized scheduling. The template based development and the plethora of already implemented SDK/API functions acts as a low-code backbone for developers - from simple IoT apps to AI augmented applications. The platform’s integration with its J33VES AI framework means developers can deploy LLMs and AI microservices seamlessly. Paying for GPU cycles in R1 tokens and leveraging multi-node training (via ChainStore for state sharing) makes distributed model training or inference both affordable and private.","Edge and Geo-Distributed Apps: Any application needing low latency or local data handling gains from Ratio1’s distributed nodes. For instance, a factory IoT app or retail analytics can run on local nodes (edge), with the blockchain orchestration handling failover to cloud if needed. This hybrid edge-cloud pattern is transparent to the dev team of the target application.","Startups and Developers: Perhaps most importantly, startups and individual developers gain a low barrier to advanced infra. With minimal upfront cost, even solo teams can deploy apps with built-in HA, databases, and SSL. They avoid needing to hire DevOps or deal with the 12-factor infra setup. The automated scaling means apps grow seamlessly under load. In a way, Ratio1 democratizes access to enterprise-grade PaaS: you pay only for usage, and the platform gives you everything else for free.","In the published Keysoft’s case study, an established software vendor re-platformed its legacy product on Ratio1. The developer team found they could \"deploy software across diverse nodes\" without rewriting their app. They retained on-prem modules for sensitive clients and still achieved global reach. Their rollouts went from manual multi-month processes to a few container deployments in Ratio1’s console - literally saving months of dev time while adding AI capabilities (like intelligent code generation) with no extra ops work.","No technology is without caveats. Ratio1 faces the usual challenges of emerging decentralized systems:","Network Scale: The platform’s benefits grow with more nodes and CSPs. In early stages, Ratio1 acknowledges the fact that coverage might be limited or compute tight in some regions. Thus, Ratio1 team will be fully involved in supporting businesses in order to make sure enough reliable nodes (and desired GPU types) are available before migrating critical workloads.","Adoption Curve: Enterprises accustomed to centralized clouds may need to adjust. They must learn Ratio1’s token-based billing and deployment model. Nevertheless, development teams will only need to learn basic containerization skills of cloud native ecosystems.","Regulatory Uncertainty: Because it involves blockchain tokens and decentralized finance mechanisms (escrow), regulatory landscapes (like crypto laws or data regulations) could impact operations. Ratio1 mitigates this by corporate governance and KYC/KYB and also focusing on adopting advanced digital resilience acts such as EU DORA.","Performance Variability: Unlike a single hyperscaler data center, a decentralized network can have more variability in network latency or uptime (even though redundancy mitigates this). That is why Ratio1 offers (and also imposes) extra horizontal scaling by default while partnering with the largest industry-standard CDN and tunneling providers.","These considerations are common for any Web3-based infra. Importantly, Ratio1’s design (KYC’d nodes, escrow, enterprise features) addresses many trust concerns up front.","Ratio1 occupies a unique niche. It complements rather than supplants Kubernetes - it embraces container orchestration standards while adding decentralization and, more importantly, the end-to-end application development paradigm. As cloud complexity and cost continue rising, there’s a clear demand for simpler, more transparent alternatives with minimized go-to-market approaches. Trends that favor Ratio1 include: growing cloud spend (leading companies to seek cheaper models), increasing focus on data privacy and sovereignty, and the rapid adoption of AI/ML (which requires scalable, cost-effective GPU resources), scarcity of data science expertise, complexions of dev-ops procedures. By being \"cloud-on-chain,\" Ratio1 is well-positioned for the Web3 era where blockchain and cloud converge.","In short, Ratio1 isn’t a \"better Kubernetes\" (it openly builds on Kubernetes concepts); it’s a decentralized Kubernetes-like platform with rich PaaS features and AI development focus. For developers and CTOs frustrated with prohibitive development resources or legacy clouds, Ratio1 offers an alternative: template based end-to-end development with all the comforts of a managed PaaS stack plus the advantages of decentralization. Investors may see it as a bridge between enterprise IT and the crypto space, capturing growth in both AI and Web3 infrastructure. If decentralized architectures and tokenized economies gain traction (as many trends suggest they will), Ratio1’s model of \"PaaS + blockchain\" could become a leading formula for the next generation of cloud computing.","Overall, Ratio1 represents a paradigm shift: from renting generic servers while building the full stack of your applications to adopting an ecosystem that automatically handles high availability, data security, and decentralized governance and offers powerful out-of-the-box development templates and tools. It gives developers the tools of modern cloud-native architecture while protecting user data and aligning incentives with tokenomics. As the platform matures and its node network grows, we envision Ratio1 as a major player in the move towards open, user-empowered cloud.","Petrica Butusina","Jul 17, 2025","‹ Stay in Control: How to Use the Ratio1 Telegram Bot to Monitor Your Nodes","6 Lessons in Building Ratio1 as a Product People Need ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

One such early adopter is Build21.io, an innovative Romanian real estate company. Build21 stands out as a pioneer by integrating blockchain technology with traditional real estate investment, using blockchain infrastructure to democratize real estate project funding and community interaction. This blockchain-driven approach made Build21 an ideal candidate to showcase how a real-world application can move off of AWS's centralized cloud onto Ratio1's decentralized cloud-edge platform.","For many startups and projects like Build21, traditional cloud platforms such as AWS offer reliability and scale, but at the cost of centralization, high expenses, and potential lock-in. Major cloud providers control roughly 80% of the cloud & AI infrastructure market, with aprox $679 billion spent on centralized cloud services in 2023. This dominance comes with drawbacks: runaway pricing, vendor lock-in, and opaque control can hinder scalability and innovation. In fact, operating on AWS often entails substantial infrastructure costs and requires specialized DevOps expertise - effectively placing much of a company's IT capabilities in the hands of the cloud provider.","Ratio1 offers an alternative path by decentralizing cloud computing. We see it described as an \"AI Operating System\" powered by blockchain, connecting many independent servers and devices into a distributed cloud for apps and AI workloads. Instead of handing over data and workloads to a single corporation's data center, you can keep your application and data on your own machines or trusted partners' nodes. This architecture provides intrinsic benefits aligned with current market trends: significantly lower infrastructure costs (up to 80% savings in some cases by utilizing spare capacity) and no single point of failure, while users retain ownership of their data. In short, Ratio1 aims to \"provide scalable and energy-efficient infrastructure without relying on centralized cloud providers\", making it attractive for organizations that value data sovereignty, censorship-resistance, and cost-effectiveness.","It's important to note that Ratio1 is not positioned as a direct competitor to big clouds like AWS, but rather as an alternative for specific needs. If a project requires running on permissioned or dedicated nodes (for compliance or trust reasons) and wants a censorship-resistant, decentralized environment, Ratio1 is designed for that scenario. The platform's philosophy - encapsulated in the \"Your app, your data (or even Your AI, your Data)\" mantra - reflects a paradigm shift toward user control and privacy. Build21, with its blockchain-centric model, found this especially appealing: migrating to Ratio1's network means their application infrastructure now aligns with the same decentralization ethos as their business model.","Before migration, Build21's system was hosted on AWS as a typical multi-module, multi-tier web application. In practice, this meant several components running across multiple AWS instances:","Two PostgreSQL databases - separate database servers holding different parts of the application data (for example, one for core transaction data and one for content or user data).","A Content Management System (CMS) - a web-based system for managing content, likely used for Build21's website or investor portal.","The main application (two-tier) - the front-end and back-end application logic, possibly split into a client-facing front-end and a server-side API.","Originally, these components were deployed in a relatively \"bare-metal\" style on AWS. In other words, instead of containerized services, the CMS and application were running directly on virtual machines (or even physical servers), each with its own environment. This kind of setup can be less portable and harder to scale. For instance, if traffic grew, the team might need to manually launch additional AWS instances or use AWS-specific services to handle scaling. There was also the overhead of managing OS-level configurations and ensuring consistency across environments.","Key challenges with the legacy AWS setup included: maintaining multiple servers (with all the patching and updates that entails), potential under-utilization of resources (each dedicated VM might not be fully used), and being tied to AWS's pricing and ecosystem. Given Build21's rapid innovation in real estate via blockchain, they needed an infrastructure that could scale on demand, reduce costs, and provide greater control over where and how their application runs.","Migrating from AWS to Ratio1 required careful planning and was facilitated by one of Ratio1's partner Cloud Service Providers (CSP). This CSP acted as a specialist, guiding Build21 through the transition. The migration proceeded in a few structured steps:","1. Containerization of the Application and CMS: The first major step was converting Build21's application components from their bare-metal AWS deployment into containers. Containerization means packaging each piece of software (e.g. the CMS, the web app backend, etc.) with all its dependencies into a standardized unit (a container) that can run anywhere. This was a crucial move because Ratio1's Deeploy uses container images to distribute workloads. By containerizing the CMS and the application, the CSP ensured that these services would run identically on Ratio1's decentralized nodes as they did on AWS.","In simple terms, a container is like a \"little box\" containing the app and everything it needs to run, so it behaves the same on any machine. This step eliminated the classic \"it works on my server but not on yours\" problem and made the deployment more cloud-native.","2. Preparing Networking (Domains and Tunnels): In a cloud environment, clients still need to reach the application via the internet. On AWS, one might use elastic IPs, load balancers, or AWS's DNS to route traffic to services. On Ratio1, the CSP used Ratio1's routing and tunnel management interface, which leverages Cloudflare Tunnel technology, to expose Build21's services. Concretely, the CSP registered Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) for the databases, CMS, and application (for example, db1.build21.ratio1.link, app.build21.ratio1.link, etc.). Each service was then configured with a Cloudflare Tunnel. Cloudflare Tunnel is a service that creates a secure, outbound connection from the host server to Cloudflare's edge network. This allows external users to reach an internal service without the server itself having a public IP or open inbound ports. In practice, a small agent (cloudflared) runs alongside the application container on the node, and it establishes an encrypted tunnel to Cloudflare. Cloudflare, in turn, handles incoming web traffic and forwards it through this tunnel to the correct service. The result is that Build21's web app and CMS became accessible at their new domains, with Cloudflare providing HTTPS, DNS, and DDoS protection automatically - all while the actual servers hosting the app remain shielded from direct public access. This setup greatly enhances security (attackers cannot directly target the origin server) and simplifies networking, since outbound connections are typically allowed by firewalls by default. The CSP configured these tunnels through Ratio1's interface, making the process straightforward.","3. \"Deeploying\" on the Ratio1 Network: With the application containerized and network routing in place, the CSP proceeded to deploy the containers onto the Ratio1 network using Ratio1 Deeploy. Ratio1's Deeploy is a decentralized container orchestration system - akin to a Kubernetes, but running via blockchain and a peer-to-peer node network. Using the Deeploy dashboard or API, the CSP initiated deployments for each component (databases, CMS, app) onto the network of Ratio1 edge nodes. One notable difference from a typical AWS deployment is that Ratio1 starts with horizontal scaling by default. In traditional AWS, you might launch one EC2 instance or one container task initially and then add more if needed. In Ratio1's model, the deployment can be specified to run multiple replicas across different nodes from the get-go. In fact, the platform is designed for automatic failover and distributed scaling - much like a cloud-native Kubernetes cluster that always aims for high availability. By deploying, say, 2 replicas of the Build21 web application across two independent nodes, the CSP ensured that the application would stay online even if one node went down. Deeploy's decentralized scheduling uses on-chain logic and oracle nodes (special nodes in the network) to decide where to run those containers in a trust-minimized way. There's no single \"master server\" deciding placements; instead, multiple orchestrator nodes reach consensus on scheduling, recorded on the blockchain. Before launching the deployment, the CSP also allocated funds (R1 tokens via USDC) for it. Ratio1 uses its utility token R1 to handle reward claiming for resource usage: running containers consumes tokens, which go to the node operators providing CPU/GPU time. The CSP acts on behalf of Build21's when funding the on-chain Ratio1 Escrow via USDC. Once CSP Escrow funded, the CSP executes the deployment - essentially submitting a \"job\" to Ratio1's network with the container images and desired replica count. Smart contracts verified the request (ensuring the deployer is authorized and has funds), and then the containers were launched on the selected edge nodes. In minutes, all of Build21's components were up and running on Ratio1. The Deeploy system automatically handled setting up the containers, connecting them to the previously configured Cloudflare tunnels, and even things like service discovery between the components.","4. Testing and Cutover: After deployment, Build21's team, alongside the CSP, performed validation tests. They verified that the web application was reachable at its new domain, that the CMS was functioning, and that both PostgreSQL databases were accessible to the app (likely through internal networking or secure tunnels as well). Data was migrated from AWS to the new databases as needed (this could have been done by backing up the AWS PostgreSQL and restoring it into the Ratio1-hosted PostgreSQL instances). Once everything was confirmed to be working identically to the AWS environment, Build21 could officially switch over user traffic to the Ratio1-based environment. This cutover may have been as simple as updating DNS to point to the new Cloudflare-managed domains (if the old AWS setup had its own domain names), or just announcing the new app URLs if they changed. The AWS resources were then scheduled for decommissioning, now that the entire stack was live on Ratio1.","Throughout the process, a guiding principle was to minimize downtime and complexity. By leveraging containerization and Cloudflare tunnels ahead of time, the migration avoided many risky low-level changes. Build21's team did not have to rewrite their application - they simply repacked it and redeployed it on a new kind of cloud. This demonstrates an advantage of sticking to cloud-native architecture: if your apps are containerized and have externalized configuration, you can port them between infrastructures with relatively little refactoring. The CSP noted that the end-to-end migration time can be much shorter when the source application is already following cloud-native best practices, such as using containers and CI/CD pipelines for deployment. In Build21's case, upfront effort was spent on containerizing legacy setups, but now that it's done, future updates or even cloud moves will be far easier.","With the full Build21 ecosystem deployed on Ratio1, the application is now running entirely outside of the traditional big-cloud environment. This migration yielded several notable benefits:","Censorship Resistance and Resilience: Build21's services no longer reside on a single company's servers (like AWS). Instead, they run on a distributed mesh of Ratio1 nodes, with no central point that can be censored or shut down unilaterally. The infrastructure is inherently more robust to outages or attacks, since even if one node fails, others can continue serving the app. This aligns with Ratio1's anti-censorship and own-your-data policy - the system is designed to keep running even under adverse conditions, and no outside entity can quietly pull the plug on Build21's servers. For Build21's users and investors, this adds confidence that the platform will remain available and tamper-proof.","Data Ownership and Privacy: By moving to Ratio1, Build21 gains greater control over its data. All application data is stored on servers (nodes) that Build21 or its chosen CSP partners operate, rather than on AWS infrastructure. This means sensitive investor or property data isn't sitting in a big tech provider's database; it's in an environment governed by Build21's own rules and the transparency of blockchain. In Ratio1, all operations (like deployments, resource usage) are logged on an immutable ledger, providing an auditable trail. The \"You Own Your Data\" principle of Ratio1 is now a reality for Build21 - there are no hidden data miners or unwelcome third-party access that can happen on a public cloud. This is especially valuable in finance-related industries (like real estate investment) where privacy and compliance are paramount.","Automatic Horizontal Scaling: A subtle but important technical improvement is that Build21's application now benefits from horizontal scaling by default. On AWS, one might initially deploy a single instance of each service and then manually add more or use an auto-scaling group when traffic grows. In contrast, Ratio1's approach encourages running at least two or more replicas of each service from the start, spread across different nodes. This means Build21's app is always load-balanced across multiple servers, improving both performance and uptime. If traffic spikes, Ratio1 can deploy additional container instances (much like Kubernetes would) to handle the load, and it can scale them down when not needed. Build21 thus gains a more elastic infrastructure that can seamlessly adjust to user demand. The horizontal scaling also ties into reliability - with multiple replicas, there's redundancy. Users should experience fewer disruptions because even if one node goes offline for maintenance or due to network issues, the other replicas continue serving requests.","Cost Efficiency and Resource Utilization: Running on Ratio1 could lower Build21's operational costs over time. The Ratio1 network utilizes many independent edge nodes, which collectively offer compute power in a marketplace-like fashion. Build21 pays only for the actual compute and storage resources they consume (via the R1 utility tokens), often at a lower rate than equivalent cloud instances. This is because Ratio1 can tap into underutilized resources globally (even idle computers) rather than relying on expensive data centers. By sharing computing resources on a global network and paying only for usage, companies can save on costs. Additionally, there are no hefty charges for data egress or premium managed services that AWS might impose. The decentralization of the infrastructure can eliminate middleman markups - node operators are directly compensated in tokens, and there's no need for large profit margins to a cloud vendor. For a company like Build21 aiming to maximize value for its investors, these savings are very attractive. Furthermore, Ratio1's incentive model (Proof-of-Availability and Proof-of-AI) ensures the network remains cost-efficient: nodes get rewards for staying online and doing real work, which encourages ample supply of computing power. In essence, Build21 now participates in a more open market for compute rather than being locked into AWS's pricing tiers.","Strategic Alignment with Web3 Ecosystem: Build21's move to Ratio1 is not just a technical migration, but also a strategic alignment with the broader Web3 and decentralization ecosystem. Build21 is leveraging blockchain for its core business (tokenized real estate investment, NFT-based investor community, etc.), using onchain crowdfunding. By hosting their application on a blockchain-powered cloud like Ratio1, they send a strong message that their commitment to decentralization is end-to-end. This could enhance their credibility among crypto-savvy investors. It also opens the door for direct integration between Build21's application and other decentralized services. For example, because Ratio1 runs on a blockchain, Build21 could potentially use on-chain logic to trigger deployments or scale resources based on smart contracts (imagine automatically provisioning more nodes when a new property token sale is underway). While AWS has blockchain services, they are still fundamentally centralized cloud offerings. With Ratio1, Build21's tech stack is fully aligned with the decentralized ethos: from funding (blockchain-based crowdfunding) to infrastructure (decentralized cloud). This synergy could simplify compliance with emerging Web3 standards and makes the overall platform more future-proof as decentralized technology evolves.","No Compromise on Performance: It's worth noting that the migration did not come at the cost of performance. Ratio1's architecture is built for high-performance AI and web applications. The use of Cloudflare's global edge network for ingress means users around the world access Build21's services with low latency (Cloudflare directs them to the nearest Cloudflare node, which then tunnels to the Ratio1 node). Internally, Ratio1's edge nodes can include powerful servers or even cloud VMs contributed by various operators, so Build21 could be running on hardware that is just as capable (or more so) than what they had on AWS. Additionally, Ratio1's distributed nature can allow placement of services closer to certain user clusters if needed (edge computing benefits). In short, from the end-user perspective, the application should feel as responsive as before - if not more so - and the team can scale it out easily via Deeploy if usage grows.","The Build21 migration showcases how a forward-thinking company can transition from a traditional cloud (AWS) to a decentralized cloud (Ratio1) to gain advantages in control, cost, and innovation. In a broader sense, this case study reflects a growing trend: organizations are exploring alternatives to the big cloud providers as they seek greater transparency and autonomy in their tech infrastructure. Decentralized cloud platforms like Ratio1 are emerging at a pivotal time - 2025 is seen as a turning point where high cloud costs, concerns over centralized control, and improved decentralized tooling are all driving interest in new models of cloud computing. For Build21, the migration was a strategic win. They were able to maintain their application functionality and user experience, while shedding the constraints of AWS. Ratio1 provided them with a trustless, blockchain-governed environment where \"no central cloud, just scale\" is the modus operandi (as the Ratio1 team likes to put it). It's a realm where their application nodes are permissioned and secure, but the overall network is open and resilient, striking a balance between control and decentralization. In practical terms, Build21 now enjoys an infrastructure where \"Your app, your data\" is the reality - the company fully owns their deployment and data, bolstered by the knowledge that the underlying network is secured by blockchain consensus and not subject to the whims of a single provider. If they ever need to expand, they can do so without negotiating new contracts or capacities with a cloud vendor; they simply use Ratio1's Deeploy to tap into more nodes, and the incentive system will attract the needed resources. Conversely, if they need to scale down, they won't be stuck paying for idle instances. Finally, it's important to emphasize that migrating to Ratio1 was not about abandoning the cloud, but about evolving with the cloud. As the Sarson Funds analysis noted, \"the shift away from hyperscaler dependence is not a rejection of cloud computing, it is a necessary evolution\". Ratio1 represents that evolution - a cloud that is decentralized, community-driven, and aligned with the principles of Web3. Build21's successful migration may inspire other companies to consider how they too can leverage this new breed of cloud platforms. In an era when multi-cloud and hybrid deployments are common, adding a decentralized cloud into the mix (or even replacing certain workloads entirely) can provide unique benefits. In summary, the Build21 case has proven that moving from AWS to Ratio1 is achievable and can be highly beneficial. It reduced dependencies on Big Tech infrastructure, gave Build21 fine-grained control and transparency, and did so while supporting their growth and innovation. As Ratio1 continues to mature (with features like decentralized storage - R1FS - and on-chain orchestration reaching mainnet), we can expect the migration process to become even smoother. And as more early adopters like Build21 make the leap, they are helping pave the way for a future where cloud computing is not just centralized in a few data centers, but spread across countless nodes owned by the community. This truly embodies a shift to \"AI powered by you\" - where anyone can own a piece of the cloud and where applications like Build21's can thrive on a platform that puts them in the driver's seat.","Petrica Butusina","Aug 2, 2025","‹ Monthly Report - July 2025.

While our initial focus has centered on Python-based plugins, pipelines, and AI applications, we recognize that fostering innovation requires embracing the diverse landscape of modern software development. Today, we're excited to announce the release of R1FS and CStore services for third-party development, with NodeJS developers as our first target community outside the Python ecosystem.","Ratio1's core mission has always been about democratizing AI and edge computing by providing powerful, easy-to-use tools that work across different skill levels and technical backgrounds. Our native applications development platform, built around the Ratio1 SDK and APIs, has proven successful in enabling Data Scientists and Python developers to create sophisticated AI-driven applications with minimal overhead.","However, true democratization means breaking down the barriers that prevent developers from different ecosystems from participating in the decentralized AI revolution. The NodeJS community, with its vibrant ecosystem of over two million packages and its proven track record in building scalable, real-time applications truly represents a natural next step in our platform expansion.","Our new edge-node-client npm package serves as the bridge between NodeJS container applications and Ratio1's powerful edge infrastructure. This client library enables seamless integration with two of our most fundamental services such as R1FS (Ratio1 File System) - Our encrypted, sharded, decentralized storage system - and CStore - the distributed in-memory database that combines the best features of Kubernetes etcd and Redis. The integration follows a sophisticated yet intuitive pattern that maintains the security and decentralization principles of the Ratio1 ecosystem while providing the familiar development experience NodeJS developers expect. Many other powerfull development features are to be added in the coming weeks and months from distributed and decentralized oriented features to pure-AI tools - all nicely packaged into template applications as you will see next.","R1FS represents a paradigm shift from traditional centralized storage solutions. Unlike conventional cloud storage services that rely on single points of failure, R1FS implements a fully decentralized, IPFS-like architecture with built-in encryption, sharding, and load balancing. The beauty of R1FS lies in its simplicity from the developer's perspective, while maintaining enterprise-grade security and reliability underneath. Each file stored in R1FS is automatically encrypted using advanced cryptographic algorithms, sharded across multiple edge nodes for redundancy, balanced to optimize storage distribution and retrieval performance, content-addressed using cryptographic hashes for immutable referencing.","CStore represents our answer to the challenge of distributed state management in edge computing environments. By combining the consistency guarantees of Kubernetes etcd with the performance characteristics of Redis, CStore enables applications to maintain synchronized state across multiple edge nodes without the complexity traditionally associated with distributed systems. The distributed nature of CStore means that state changes propagated by one node are automatically synchronized across the entire network, enabling truly collaborative applications that can scale across multiple edge devices while maintaining data consistency","To demonstrate the power and simplicity of our new NodeJS integration, we've developed a comprehensive example application: Ratio1 Drive. This decentralized file sharing application showcases both R1FS and CStore in action, providing a practical reference implementation for developers.","Application Architecture","The Ratio1 Drive application follows a sophisticated yet intuitive pattern:","- File Upload - users connect to any available DriveApp node and upload files","- Decentralized Storage - files are automatically committed to R1FS with encryption and sharding","- Metadata Distribution - File metadata and Content IDs (CIDs) are broadcast via CStore","- Global Visibility - All nodes in the ecosystem can see files uploaded by any user","- Privacy Controls - Users can mark files as public or private","Thust, the Ratio1 Drive template application demonstrates several key capabilities that make it more than just a simple file sharing service such as:","- Node Contribution Tracking: The application tracks which nodes contribute to file storage and retrieval, providing transparency into the decentralized network's operation.","- Real-time Synchronization: Changes made on one node are immediately visible across all other nodes in the network, thanks to CStore's real-time state synchronization.","- Cryptographic Verification: Every file operation includes cryptographic verification to ensure data integrity and authenticity","- Scalable Architecture: The application can handle multiple concurrent users across different nodes without centralized coordination","Enjoy the application at https://drive.ratio1.ai","And/or spin-off, fork, develop, publish your own starting from the template https://github.com/Ratio1/ratio1-drive","Enabling cross-platform innovation is critical as NodeJS is a clear gateway to broader adoption. The choice to prioritize NodeJS support stems from both practical and strategic considerations. NodeJS has emerged as a dominant force in edge computing applications, particularly for scenarios requiring: real-time data processing with low latency, scalable microservices architectures, IoT device integration and management and rapid prototyping and deployment.","Moreover, NodeJS developers represent a significant portion of the global developer community, with the npm ecosystem containing over two million packages. By providing first-class support for NodeJS, we're opening the door for a massive community of developers to participate in the decentralized AI revolution.","Worth to mention is that recent industry research reveals compelling trends that support our NodeJS-first approach as 70% of developers prioritize cross-compatibility when selecting development tools, companies using well-documented SDKs report 30% faster deployment cycles, 68% of developers consider multi-platform support essential for development toolkits and finally organizations with updated SDKs experience 40% lower bug report rates.","These statistics underscore the importance of providing comprehensive, well-documented, and regularly maintained development tools that work across multiple platforms.","The convergence of edge computing and containerized applications represents a significant market opportunity. Current trends show:","- Edge container services are becoming essential for latency-sensitive applications","- NodeJS applications at the edge are particularly well-suited for real-time processing scenarios","- Containerized deployment models with built-in AI/ML capabilities are in high demand","Thus Ratio1's approach of providing containerized NodeJS applications with seamless access to decentralized storage and state management positions us at the forefront of these trends.","Vitalii Toderian","Jul 31, 2025","‹ Migrating Build21 from AWS to Ratio1","Stay in Control: How to Use the Ratio1 Telegram Bot to Monitor Your Nodes ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

Our First On-Chain Month","description":"Ratio1’s July 2025 recap: product launches, Base ecosystem growth, PoAI rollout, cloud migrations, and research milestones.","keywords":"","h1":["Monthly Report - July 2025. Our First On-Chain Month"],"h2":["Liquidity and Ecosystem Growth","Advancing the Product Roadmap","Proof-of-AI and Cloud Migration Progress","Research and Innovation Updates"],"h3":[],"h4":[],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["General","News","Our first on-chain month on Base is officially in the books. As we wrap up July 2025, we’re taking a moment to reflect and share our progress. This monthly report serves both as an update for the community and as a valuable introspection exercise for our team. July 2025 was a hugely packed month on the commercial, adoption, and technology fronts. In addition to executing our roadmap, we achieved several notable developments:","We launched a second R1 liquidity pool on Aerodrome, the primary DEX of Base, with incentive support from the Aerodrome team. This added more liquidity to the R1 token and it served as a positive signal for a relevant player in the Base ecosystem.","The R1 token benefited from further exposure through new wallet support and listings. Trust Wallet recognized R1 and officially whitelisted the token, meaning now anyone can locate and import R1 more easily.","We hit key roadmap goals (below) including R1FS storage upgrade, CStore v1 launch and R1 Edge Services - all shown in the demo.","Read on to learn about the big achievements of last month and why they matter, from product advancements and Proof-of-AI integration to research papers.","July saw significant growth in Ratio1’s on-chain ecosystem. Our second liquidity pool went live on Aerodrome, which is Base’s leading automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity hub. This pool (R1 paired with USDC) was not only launched by our team but also incentivized by Aerodrome’s team, meaning liquidity providers can earn extra rewards. Such support from Aerodrome underscores their confidence in Ratio1’s potential and gives R1 holders easier trading and entry points. Increased liquidity on a top Base DEX can help stabilize the token economy and invite new participants into the network.","Being deployed on Base (Coinbase’s Layer-2 blockchain) has proven advantageous. Base is rapidly growing as a hub for innovative projects, and Ratio1 stands out as an advanced decentralized AI compute platform in that ecosystem. Over the month, we’ve also improved token accessibility. The R1 token is now tracked on major aggregators (like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko) and supported in popular wallets. Notably, Trust Wallet’s whitelisting of R1 makes it seamless for users to find and manage our token. This kind of integration “reaches the masses -– one wallet at a time,” as our team quipped. Altogether, these strides in market presence mean a broader community can participate in Ratio1 -– be it by running nodes, providing liquidity, or simply holding R1.","On the technical side, we achieved several important roadmap milestones in July. Foremost was closing the R1FS migration (Roadmap item R1-330) to its new version and finalizing CStore v1 (R1-312 & R1-249). Both R1FS and CStore are core components of Ratio1’s decentralized cloud architecture. For those unfamiliar, R1FS is our distributed file storage system: an IPFS-based global file system that shards and encrypts data across nodes for secure, fault-tolerant storage. This provides every app on Ratio1 with encrypted, persistent storage without relying on a central data center. Alongside it, CStore (ChainStore) is a distributed in-memory key-value database akin to a decentralized Redis cache. CStore v1’s completion means developers can now easily share state and cache data across containers in a Ratio1 deployment, with the platform handling consistency behind the scenes.","We also launched R1 Edge Services (R1-313), a new capability that allows locally executed third-party apps (or edge devices) to securely interface with Ratio1’s services. In practice, this opens the door for hybrid deployments – for example, an on-premise container could leverage Ratio1’s network storage (R1FS) or database (CStore) via authenticated channels. It extends Ratio1’s functionality beyond purely on-chain or in-network apps, bridging to external environments when needed.","All these advances – the upgraded R1FS, the CStore v1, and the new Edge Services – were showcased in our “R1 Drive” demo. R1 Drive is a multi-node, distributed decentralized storage application we developed to highlight the technology in action. It serves as both a practical tool and a reference template for developers. In the demo, files are uploaded and retrieved across multiple nodes, in order to show how R1FS ensures redundancy and privacy, as well as how CStore can keep track of metadata or application state.  R1 Drive is also our first full NodeJS app template (built with Next.js) that anyone can fork, modify, and deploy on Ratio1. By open-sourcing this demo, we provide a starting point for others to build their own decentralized apps – whether for commercial services, education, or other purposes – by leveraging Ratio1’s “Kubernetes-plus” platform capabilities.","Importantly, these product milestones demonstrate the end-to-end nature of Ratio1’s platform. An app running on Ratio1 automatically benefits from distributed storage, a built-in database, and secure networking, all orchestrated by smart contracts and oracles. As one of our earlier blog posts noted, developers can launch microservices that are load-balanced, scalable, and ready to use without worrying about infrastructure. The progress in July brings us closer to that vision, making the developer experience smoother and the system’s reliability higher.","While our full Proof-of-AI (PoAI) rollout is officially scheduled for August, we made significant headway by deploying a first version of the PoAI protocol this month. This initial implementation is fully integrated with our backend Deeploy API, and we also rolled out the first beta of the Deeploy UI – an end-to-end web console for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to use Ratio1. In essence, CSP partners (or any organization running Ratio1 nodes) can now use the Deeploy interface to submit AI workloads, manage deployments, and observe jobs being distributed to their nodes. This marks the true start of PoAI job distribution within the Ratio1 network.","Why is PoAI so important? In Ratio1’s dual-consensus model, PoAI works in tandem with Proof-of-Availability (which rewards uptime) to ensure that new R1 tokens are only minted for doing useful AI work. Instead of burning electricity on arbitrary hashing (like Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work), PoAI rewards nodes for carrying out real machine learning tasks – such as model inference or training – that are verifiably useful computations.","This is part of a broader trend in decentralized infrastructure: networks want to prove real-world work is being done, rather than simply running pointless puzzles.","For example, other projects have also explored “Proof of AI” consensus to ensure participants are indeed contributing compute power rather than wasting emissions pretending to act as a node.","Ratio1’s PoAI implementation is directly tied into our on-chain reward system, so node operators get fairly rewarded with R1 for doing AI or other processing tasks, and those who try to game the system without doing work are punished.","As one article noted, aligning incentives this way enhances the trustworthiness and scalability of decentralized AI networks. With PoAI now active in beta form, we are beginning to route actual AI workloads through the Ratio1 network and issuing rewards accordingly – a huge step toward our vision of a decentralized AI cloud.","Alongside PoAI, we pursued an ambitious goal of migrating existing cloud applications onto Ratio1. In July, we successfully completed the first migration (roadmap item R1-293) of a full AWS-based application stack into the Ratio1 environment. This included the app’s backend services, frontend, content management system, and databases – essentially an entire cloud deployment reproduced on Ratio1.","The migration demonstrated how Ratio1 can work over as a decentralized drop-in alternative to traditional cloud hosting, while our platform took care of container orchestration, networking, and stateful services out-of-the-box. The takeaway for businesses thinking about cloud sovereignty or cost-efficient scaling is that it is possible to run sophisticated multi-tier applications on a decentralized network without depending on AWS or any other hyperscaler.","Originally, we had two cloud migrations on our roadmap for July, but we decided to push the second migration to August, as the overall ecosystem for that second specific application required additional tuning and migration tools.","That was a good call as it allows us to spend the proper amount of time on any complex dependencies or architecting changes that for a smooth transition. These resulting tools will nevertheless help us dramatically accelerate similar processes in the future.","Enterprise applications can have many interconnected services and we want each migration to be robust. The slight delay emphasizes our focus on doing it right rather than quickly and positions to execute a smooth secondary migration in the weeks ahead.","By August, with PoAI fully live and another migrated app under our belt, Ratio1 will further prove its capability as a general-purpose cloud platform.","On the research front, July was equally rewarding. Earlier in the year we submitted a research paper describing Ratio1’s architecture and innovations, and in May we presented it at the 25th International Conference on Control Systems and Computer Science (CSCS-25) in Bucharest. We’re excited to share that not only was the paper well-received at the conference, but it has also been accepted for publication by IEEE (and is currently in the process of being uploaded to IEEE Xplore). In practical terms, this means Ratio1’s concepts are being validated in the academic community. The paper outlines our vision of Ratio1 as a “meta-OS” for AI infrastructure, a concept we highlighted at CSCS-25. It details components like R1 OracleSync (for secure task validation), ChainDist (for decentralized job scheduling), as well as R1FS and CStore, and how they all work together in a blockchain-powered cloud stack. Having this work published through IEEE lends credibility to our approach and allows others to learn from or build upon our design. We consider the research milestone essentially complete – the paper was accepted, presented, and the camera-ready version submitted – now we’re just awaiting the formal appearance on IEEE Xplore.","Meanwhile, we haven’t been resting on our laurels in R&D. Our team has been hard at work on a third research paper that will dive even deeper into Ratio1’s novel mechanisms. This upcoming paper is set to explore the inner workings of our Proof-of-AI mechanics, the internal blockchain consensus, and the orchestration techniques that enable Ratio1 to coordinate containers and AI tasks across distributed nodes. That is to say, we’re lifting the hood  on how Ratio1 network achieves trustless coordination (e.g. how nodes agree on task results via oracles, fault tolerance of the network, etc.).","Hopefully, this information will be useful for others in the wider decentralized compute/AI ecosystem.","By publishing our research we’re contributing to the state of the art and opening up our platform to peer review, facilitating transparency. The research will document what we built but also why we made certain design choices (e.g. our dual consensus model, license-based token emission etc.) and how it compares to other approaches. We are aiming for an appropriate journal or conference for this paper, and more details on that to follow soon.","July checklist is beyond our core roadmap items and ecosystem integrations, it has established Ratio1 as a key player in the decentralized AI space:","We launched the R1:USDC Uniswap v2 LP and locked it for 12 months via Unvest, in order to signal long-term commitment to token liquidity and stability. We also expanded our DeFi footprint beyond Base, launching the R1:USDC LP + Farm on PancakeSwap.","The R1:USDC Aerodrome v3 LP went live along with an incentivized farming program, offering even more liquidity and yield for LPs.","A total of 125 Node Deed (ND) licenses were sold in July, a testament to interest in participating in Ratio1's compute network.","KeySoft and Build21 (fully migrated to Ratio1) two infrastructure-focused companies, have started migrating parts of their infrastructure to Ratio1, validating our value proposition for decentralized cloud computing.","R1 token was officially whitelisted on Ledger Live, MetaMask, Trust Wallet and Family Wallets, making the token much more accessible and usable across major crypto platforms.","In July, the official Ratio1 Whitepaper was released for both the community and prospective partners - diving deep into our technical architecture, tokenomics, and consensus models.","We are proud to announce that Cloudflare awarded Ratio1 with a $250K infrastructure grant, in recognition of our proximity to where next-gen cloud innovation is happening.","We launched the Ratio1 Node Monitoring Bot, a tool to track node status in real-time to help community node operators and CSPs with uptime visibility.","R1 is now live on Spritz Finance’s infrastructure card, allowing users to spend R1 tokens in real-world transactions through connected Visa rails.","We organized our first X Space with the core team, where the community could ask questions and hear from our builders.","We launched the Ratio1 Ambassadors Program designed to empower those in our community who want to contribute by spreading  grassroots awareness of our mission.","We released the official Ratio1 pricing list for compute and orchestration services so developers and partners can budget for decentralized infrastructure.","We did a live demo of R1FS and CStore on X, allowing the public to experience the performance and capabilities of our decentralized storage and state management tools.","So all in all, it has been a strong first Month 1 on-chain for Ratio1.","We expanded liquidity and community access, delivered on key technical promises, initiated our Proof-of-AI era, and made strides in both practical deployments and theoretical research. All these facets – commercial, technological, and academic – feed into each other. The growing on-chain activity and token distribution (via PoA/PoAI) give us real-world data and momentum. The product improvements and migrations prove out our claims in real scenarios, making the platform more attractive to users. The research efforts ensure we remain on the cutting edge and help distinguish Ratio1 in a crowded “AI+blockchain” field.","Importantly, we’ve done this while maintaining our core principle: democratizing AI through decentralization. In a world where AI services are often tied to big cloud providers, Ratio1 offers an alternative where anyone can operate an AI node or launch an AI-powered app, with trust guaranteed by on-chain mechanisms. As our Base blockchain smart contracts are immutable and our tokenomics are transparent (with no VCs or premine), the community can trust the platform’s rules. The first month of operations has validated many of our assumptions. It also taught us where we can improve – whether it’s smoothing out the user experience in the Deeploy console or optimizing the performance of R1FS in high-load situations.","As we roll into August, we are thrilled to be finalizing the full network rollout of Proof-of-AI, deployment of our second cloud app migration, and adding new node operators and CSP partners. We expect even more community growth as the word spreads and as Base’s ecosystem grows around us. Outside the hype, things are looking up: public interest in decentralized cloud computing is still strong as ever, and most would agree that marrying blockchain to AI tasks could potentially provide a model to serve globally scalable and privacy-preserving AI services. Ratio1 is emerging as a leader in this movement.","A big thanks to everyone who joined us in this first on-chain month, be it as a liquidity provider, running a node, facilitating migrations (CSP), providing feedback, or simply following along. Building this with the community, we are more excited than ever about what is to follow. Here is to Month #2, the #BaseSummer and beyond!","Petrica Butusina","Aug 3, 2025","‹ Introducing the Ratio1 ROI Calculator","Migrating Build21 from AWS to Ratio1 ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

It aims to empower security teams with a distributed pentesting toolset that can run across multiple edge nodes (via Ratio1) instead of on a single machine. This unique architecture promises advantages in scalability, resiliency, and security. In this analysis, we compare RedMesh to existing offerings - from traditional pentest tools to modern AI-driven platforms - highlighting its differentiators (especially decentralization, distribution, and security features). We also discuss how RedMesh might be positioned in the market and propose service pricing ranges, considering that the product is open source (hence freely deployable by others on Ratio1 with infrastructure costs).","RedMesh’s core features set it apart from typical penetration testing solutions:","Decentralized & Distributed Execution: RedMesh operates on the Ratio1 decentralized edge computing network, allowing pentest tasks to be split across multiple nodes rather than one central server. This means no single point of failure or control - tasks can be run in parallel from different geographic or network vantage points for broader coverage. In contrast, most other pentesting tools run on a single host or a centrally-managed cluster.","Security and Trust: By leveraging Ratio1’s blockchain-based infrastructure, RedMesh can ensure secure communication and coordination without a central controller. Identities and permissions of nodes and users are enforced via decentralized authentication (Ratio1’s dAuth) and smart contracts, preventing unauthorized access. Data from tests can be encrypted such that intermediate node operators cannot snoop on sensitive payloads or results. This trustless design (tasks and results validated on-chain) adds confidence and tamper-resistance beyond what standard client-server tools offer.","Open-Source Availability: RedMesh is completely open source, allowing organizations to inspect, modify, and self-host the framework. This openness contrasts with many commercial pentest platforms that are proprietary. Open source fosters community contributions (new exploit modules, integrations, etc.) and avoids vendor lock-in. It also means any company can take RedMesh’s code and deploy it on Ratio1 as their own service, which influences competitive dynamics (more on pricing later).","Continuous Pentesting Capability: Because it runs on always-on distributed nodes, RedMesh can facilitate continuous or frequent security testing (not just one-off scans). Organizations could schedule regular automated attacks or monitoring using RedMesh nodes working 24/7, providing ongoing assessment rather than a “snapshot” audit. This aligns with the industry trend toward continuous security validation (somewhat analogous to how Synack and other platforms offer year-round testing.","Scalability and Performance: By adding more Ratio1 edge nodes, a RedMesh deployment can scale to handle larger target environments or more aggressive testing without overwhelming any single node. For example, numerous network segments or web applications could be scanned/exploited in parallel. Traditional frameworks might face scaling challenges in very large environments when limited to one machine, whereas RedMesh’s mesh can expand dynamically.","Resilience and Stealth: Distributing the pentest across many nodes can improve resilience - if one node goes down or is blocked by defensive measures, others can continue the operation. It can also simulate a real-world attacker botnet or advanced persistent threat more realistically, coming from multiple IPs or regions. This multi-source approach might evade simple IP-based blocking or make detection harder, providing a tougher test of an organization’s detection capabilities (since attacks aren’t all from one IP or location).","Together, these features position RedMesh as a cutting-edge framework merging the benefits of open-source community-driven development with decentralized cloud power and strong security assurances. Next, we’ll see how it compares to other offerings in the pentesting market.","The penetration testing and offensive security tool market is crowded, ranging from free hacker tools to enterprise SaaS platforms. RedMesh will face competition from several categories of solutions:","Traditional Open-Source Pentest Tools: These include frameworks like Metasploit, Burp Suite (Community Edition), Nmap, OWASP ZAP, SQLmap, etc. For instance, Metasploit is a well-known open-source exploitation framework included in Kali Linux. Such tools are widely used by security professionals and come with extensive modules or capabilities (Metasploit alone has hundreds of exploit payloads and supports post-exploitation scripting. However, they generally run on a single system. Unlike RedMesh, they are not inherently distributed - any parallelization must be managed manually or via custom scripting. They also typically require a skilled operator to manually coordinate attacks, whereas RedMesh could orchestrate tasks across nodes automatically.","Commercial Automated Pentesting Platforms: Several companies offer automated security testing products that simulate attacks. Pentera (formerly Pcysys) is one leading example - an automated security validation platform that emulates real attack techniques across internal and external assets. Products like Pentera provide user-friendly interfaces and reporting for continuous testing of networks, credentials, and more, without requiring human hackers on each run. Another example is BreachLock or Cymulate, which deliver “Pentest-as-a-Service” using a combination of automation and expert oversight (often marketed as continuous automated penetration testing or breach-and-attack simulation). These solutions are typically proprietary and centralized - e.g., Pentera deploys within an organization’s network or cloud and uses algorithms to conduct attacks, but it does not leverage a decentralized node mesh. RedMesh’s decentralized model is a differentiator: it can use nodes in different locations (even outside the target’s own environment), while commercial platforms usually run from one appliance or cloud instance. In terms of security, closed-source platforms require trusting the vendor’s software and cloud; RedMesh’s open code and blockchain-based trust might appeal to organizations wanting transparency or on-prem control.","Crowdsourced Pentesting Services: Platforms like Synack and Cobalt connect clients with a vetted global community of human ethical hackers to perform on-demand pentests or continuous testing. Synack, for example, offers a private, managed bug bounty-style service with hundreds of skilled researchers worldwide, delivering “the industry’s most comprehensive, continuous penetration test with actionable results,” augmented by an AI-enabled platform. These services leverage human creativity and diverse skills: a crowd of researchers can often find more complex logic flaws or novel attack vectors than automated tools. However, they are not software frameworks but rather services, typically with high costs (often tens of thousands of dollars per engagement or per year for continuous testing). They also involve humans in the loop, meaning speed and coverage can vary. RedMesh does not directly crowdsource human testers; instead, it crowdsources compute power on a decentralized network. In some sense, RedMesh could enable a different kind of crowdsourced pentest: multiple node operators contribute CPU/network resources, but the test logic is automated. The advantage is speed and low marginal cost - automated agents can run 24/7 and scale easily - whereas Synack’s model provides human insight at higher cost. The disadvantage is that RedMesh (as an automated tool) might miss complex business-logic issues or creative attack chains that skilled humans could catch. In positioning, RedMesh might be seen as complementary to crowdsourced human testing: it can handle the continuous, automated onslaught of known techniques, while occasional expert-driven tests handle creative scenarios.","Vulnerability Scanners and Management Tools: Many organizations rely on vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., OpenVAS/Greenbone, Nessus, Qualys Guard) to find common flaws. OpenVAS is an open-source scanner that covers a huge number of CVEs and is free to use, providing basic network vulnerability scanning at no cost. Nessus (by Tenable) is a commercial scanner with similar coverage; it has a free limited version and paid tiers with more features. Scanners are less comprehensive than full pentesting frameworks - they focus on detecting known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, not actually exploiting them or doing chained attacks. RedMesh could incorporate scanning modules but also go further into exploitation and post-exploitation (more like a true pentest). In terms of competition, the price factor is notable: open-source scanners like OpenVAS are free to run, whereas commercial ones like Nessus Professional can cost ~$2,000+ annually per scanner license. (Greenbone’s enterprise OpenVAS-based service is ~€2,524 per year for small companies). RedMesh being open-source means it similarly has a low cost to adopt (you pay nothing for the software, just the infrastructure), making it attractive compared to expensive scanner licenses. However, established scanners have years of development, polished UIs, compliance reports, and vendor support - RedMesh will need to prove itself in reliability and breadth of detection/exploitation capabilities.","Red Team & Adversary Simulation Tools: These include frameworks like Cobalt Strike (a popular commercial red team command-and-control toolkit), MITRE Caldera (open-source adversary emulation platform), Atomic Red Team (open library of scripted attacks), and others. Cobalt Strike is used for targeted red team operations, with features for stealthy command-and-control, but it’s centralized (one team server coordinating “beacons” on target machines) and quite expensive. Caldera is open-source and allows automation of attacker behavior via agents on endpoints, orchestrated by a central server - somewhat analogous to RedMesh in that it uses multiple agents, though Caldera is typically deployed within a single organization’s network for internal testing. RedMesh differs by focusing on distributed external pentesting - it’s about launching attacks from a mesh of nodes towards targets, rather than simulating compromise inside the network (though conceivably RedMesh could also be used to orchestrate internal agents if extended). In positioning, RedMesh could fill a niche for organizations that want an autonomous “red team” machine operating from outside, continuously probing their perimeter (and potentially internal assets if a node is placed behind the firewall), without the high cost or manual effort of a consulting red team.","AI-Driven Pentesting Tools: A very recent development in the market is the application of AI and large language models to automate penetration testing tasks. For example, researchers at Alias Robotics introduced CAI (Cybersecurity AI), an open-source framework where multiple specialized AI agents collaborate (with human guidance) to perform steps of an attack - reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, etc. In trials, CAI’s agents were able to exploit some vulnerabilities dramatically faster than humans, and overall AI+human workflows were on average 11× faster than manual efforts. Moreover, coordinated agent teams have outperformed traditional scanners in some cases and are approaching human-level success rates at a fraction of the cost. This suggests future pentesting may rely heavily on intelligent automation. RedMesh itself is not explicitly an AI system (at least in the information available so far), but it could potentially integrate AI modules or benefit from similar concepts (for instance, automating more decision-making across the distributed nodes). Competitors in this space would include CAI (if adopted in practice), or proprietary AI-based pentest services from startups or big tech. RedMesh’s decentralization could complement AI: imagine AI-driven pentest agents deployed across a decentralized network, combining RedMesh’s infrastructure with advanced decision-making - this could be very powerful and entirely community-driven. In its current positioning, RedMesh’s distinction is more about architecture (decentralized, secure network of nodes) rather than intelligence. To compete with emerging AI solutions, RedMesh might need to incorporate machine learning for tasks like smart target discovery or exploit selection.","In summary, the competitive landscape ranges from classic tools (Metasploit, Burp) to cloud services (Synack, Pentera) and new AI frameworks. RedMesh is unique in being both open-source and decentralized. Most alternatives are one or the other, not both (e.g., OpenVAS is open-source but not distributed; Synack is distributed across humans but not open-source; Pentera is automated but closed-source and centralized; CAI is open-source AI but not decentralized). This uniqueness can be a double-edged sword: RedMesh can differentiate strongly, but it must educate the market on the benefits of decentralization for pentesting, which is a relatively novel concept.","Given these comparisons, where does RedMesh fit best and what are its ideal use cases?","Cost-Sensitive Organizations: Because it’s open-source, RedMesh appeals to companies or government agencies that prefer not to pay hefty license fees for commercial tools. They can deploy RedMesh on commodity hardware or cloud instances (as Ratio1 nodes) and incur minimal software cost - essentially just the node runtime cost (around $75 per month per Ratio1 edge node as noted) and personnel to operate it. For example, a small security team could run a continuous pentest lab with 1-2 nodes for under $200/month in infrastructure, which is far cheaper than hiring external pentesters or subscribing to enterprise platforms. Open source also means no long procurement cycles; anyone can try RedMesh freely.","Firms Embracing Decentralized Tech: Organizations already interested in blockchain, decentralized computing, or collaborative networks might be early adopters of RedMesh. They will appreciate the trust-minimized design - e.g. a consortium of companies could share a RedMesh network where each contributes a node, collectively testing each other’s systems in a secure manner (with on-chain logging and mutual trust). Such a setup would be very hard to achieve with traditional tools.","Continuous and Autonomous Testing Needs: Enterprises that want continuous testing/monitoring of their attack surface (sometimes dubbed “Continuous Automated Red Team” or “purple teaming”) could leverage RedMesh to schedule nonstop operations. For instance, RedMesh could be configured to periodically scan for new open ports, attempt common exploits, or validate that no misconfigurations have appeared, across various environments. This is similar to what some security teams do by scripting Nmap or Metasploit on cron jobs - but RedMesh provides a more integrated and distributed way to do it. It essentially positions itself as an autonomous penetration testing platform (especially if combined with AI in the future), running in the background like a security guardian. This addresses the drawback of point-in-time pentests that Synack highlighted - instead of a one-time snapshot, you get ongoing coverage.","Testing from Multiple Perspectives: RedMesh can launch attacks from outside the target’s network (from diverse nodes). This makes it well-suited for testing perimeter defenses (web apps, external networks) from a truly external perspective. At the same time, one could deploy a RedMesh node inside a network segment (e.g., on an internal server or a container in a VPC) to simulate an insider threat or a breach point, while coordinating with external nodes. This multi-angle capability is valuable for enterprises with complex infrastructure - it’s like having a coordinated team of “bots” attacking you from inside and out simultaneously, which few other frameworks easily support.","Security Service Providers: Paradoxically, even those who might be “competitors” (security consultancies, managed security service providers) could become users of RedMesh. Since any company can take the open-source RedMesh and run it on Ratio1, a pentesting firm might spin up RedMesh to augment their consultants’ efforts. For example, a consulting team could deploy 10 RedMesh nodes on Ratio1 during a client engagement to perform broad reconnaissance and scanning, while the human testers focus on analyzing results and trying complex exploits. This hybrid approach could increase efficiency. However, this also means if Ratio1 (or a partner) plans to offer RedMesh as a commercial service, they must deliver enough value-add (ease of use, support, proprietary modules, integration, etc.) because these same service providers could just run it themselves at cost. The open-source nature encourages broad adoption but may limit how much one can charge purely for the software usage.","Challenges and Limitations: In positioning fairly, we note some potential downsides of RedMesh relative to competitors: - Being tied to Ratio1 could be a barrier for some - organizations might be unfamiliar with Ratio1 or hesitant to rely on a blockchain network for their tooling. The need to run Ratio1 nodes (and possibly purchase Node Deed licenses or hold tokens) adds complexity compared to a simple download-and-run tool. RedMesh “works only on Ratio1,” so one cannot deploy it on other networks or offline easily, which could limit adoption until Ratio1 itself is more widespread. - As a new framework (currently at PoC stage in 2025), RedMesh likely has a smaller ecosystem of plugins and less proven stability than mature tools like Metasploit or Burp which have been refined over decades. Users might initially use RedMesh for specific tasks (like distributed scanning) but still rely on proven tools for other tasks until RedMesh’s library of exploits, payloads, and modules grows. - Competing with established vendors will require RedMesh to demonstrate real-world effectiveness. Enterprises might ask: does this actually find critical vulnerabilities that Nessus or a human pentester would find? Does it reduce the workload or is it noisy? The unbiased truth is that automated tools have historically had limitations - many companies still find that a skilled human can discover issues automated scanners miss. RedMesh’s decentralization doesn’t automatically solve that; it improves how tests are run, but the what (the test logic) needs to be comprehensive and smart. Thus, RedMesh’s success will hinge on its ability to integrate advanced techniques (possibly AI as mentioned) and a rich set of attack methods. The open-source model might accelerate this via community contributions if the project gains traction.","Overall, RedMesh should be positioned as a complementary tool in a security arsenal rather than a drop-in replacement for all pentesting approaches. Its strengths lie in automation, scale, and cost-effectiveness for routine testing, whereas humans and traditional tools will still be used for deep-dive analysis in the near term. If marketed correctly, RedMesh could slot into the market as “the first decentralized pentest platform”, appealing to innovation-friendly customers and undercutting expensive competitors on price for comparable automated testing tasks.","Because RedMesh is open source and can be self-hosted, pricing for any RedMesh-based service must mainly justify the infrastructure, support, and convenience provided. The base cost to run RedMesh is relatively straightforward: each Ratio1 edge node required costs about $75 per month (to operate continuously with the RedMesh stack, per user info). If an organization or provider runs N nodes, the raw monthly cost is roughly $75 × N (plus perhaps small overhead for bandwidth or Ratio1 network fees, which we’ll assume negligible for now). Keeping this in mind, here are some pricing model thoughts:","Self-Hosted (DIY) Cost: An organization with technical expertise could deploy RedMesh on their own. Their expenses would be:","Node costs: ~$75/month per node on Ratio1 (e.g., running a Docker container on a cloud VM or dedicated host with required specs) - effectively the “compute” cost.","Management overhead: the time of security engineers to configure tasks, analyze results, and maintain the system. This is variable - a small team might handle it as part of their duties.","For example, a small business might run 1 node ($75/mo) to periodically scan their few web apps, and have an IT security staff interpret findings. This is very low cost compared to traditional pentests (which could be $5,000-$20,000 for a one-time engagement). Even scaling up, 5 nodes would be ~$375/month in infrastructure - still under $5,000 per year, which is cheaper than many single commercial scanner licenses or a bug bounty program payout for a critical bug. This DIY approach is cost-attractive, but requires comfort with operating the tool and addressing whatever it finds.","Managed Service Pricing: There is an opportunity for Ratio1 (or partners) to offer RedMesh-as-a-Service - basically a cloud service where the provider runs the nodes and provides a nice interface, support, and perhaps proprietary enhancements. Since customers could theoretically replicate it themselves, the pricing has to be reasonable. We propose pricing tiers akin to a SaaS subscription, roughly correlating with the number of nodes or targets:","Starter Plan (Single-Node): ~$170-$270 per month for a managed single node running RedMesh. This would cover the $75 infrastructure cost plus a margin for support and maintenance. At this tier, a client might get continuous scanning of a small environment or a couple of IPs/apps, with basic reports. This pricing competes with entry-level vulnerability management tools. (For context, Greenbone’s basic vulnerability scanning service is ~€2,524/year (~$210/month), and some cloud-based scanners charge a few hundred per month for small scopes.)","Professional Plan (Multi-Node, e.g. 5 Nodes): ~$500-$800 per month for a managed cluster of around 5 nodes. This would allow more aggressive or broader testing (e.g., testing multiple subnets simultaneously, or simulating a larger botnet attack). The raw node cost is ~$375, so this pricing leaves room for value-add. At this level, the service might include advanced scheduling (24/7 testing on rotation), better analytics dashboards, and perhaps integration with ticketing systems (so that vulnerabilities found are auto-filed in JIRA, for example). This tier would aim to appeal to mid-sized companies or MSSPs who want continuous testing without building it themselves.","Enterprise Plan (Custom/Unlimited): ~$1,000+ per month (scaling upward based on nodes or targets). Large enterprises or service providers might need 10, 20, or more nodes to cover extensive infrastructure. For instance, 20 nodes cost $1,500 in raw terms; a service might charge ~$2,000-$3,000/month for fully managed use of that capacity, which could still be an order of magnitude less than hiring a full-time team of human pentesters. At these higher tiers, the provider could offer premium support, custom exploit modules, on-call security analysts to triage RedMesh findings, etc. The idea is to bundle automation with human expertise - similar to how Synack uses both hackers and AI, a RedMesh enterprise service might include some expert oversight to validate critical findings (ensuring the results are actionable, not just a flood of scanner output).","These ranges are speculative but attempt to balance the open-source DIY cost vs. the convenience of a turnkey service. The margins are not huge (unlike proprietary software) because customers know the underlying tech is free - so the service must compete on saving the customer’s time and providing reliability. Transparency in pricing could be a selling point: e.g., “you’re paying us $X, which covers the Y nodes we run for you plus expert support.”","Per-Engagement or Usage-Based Pricing: Another model is to charge based on usage if offering RedMesh on-demand. For example, a security firm might use RedMesh for a one-off pentest engagement for a client. They could price it similar to current pentests but slightly lower due to automation. Suppose a traditional manual pentest for a web app costs $10,000 over two weeks. With RedMesh, the firm might complete it faster or with fewer people. They could charge maybe $6,000-$8,000, run a cluster of nodes intensively for a week (costing perhaps $100 in node-time), and use consultants only for analysis. The client still gets a professional report, and the firm improves profit margin by automating work. From the client’s perspective, they got a thorough test for less cost. However, this model blurs with general consulting pricing, so it’s less about RedMesh’s price and more about how service providers leverage it. If RedMesh becomes known and trusted, clients might specifically request an “automated continuous pentesting” service and expect to pay e.g. a monthly retainer rather than a big one-time fee. This could shift pricing toward a subscription model as described above, even for consulting companies (they might sell a subscription to quarterly tests powered by RedMesh rather than a single annual test).","Value vs. Competition: It’s worth noting how these proposed prices compare to competition:","A platform like Pentera (automated pentest software) is rumored to be quite expensive - often only justified for large enterprises (exact figures are not public, but one can assume tens of thousands of dollars annual license). RedMesh services at a few thousand a month could undercut that significantly, making similar capabilities accessible to smaller firms.","Synack and crowdsourced programs can run $100k+ per year for continuous testing with top hackers. RedMesh isn’t directly equivalent, but if an organization cannot afford Synack, a $1k/month RedMesh-based solution offering continuous automated tests is an attractive middle ground.","Traditional scanners like Nessus Pro cost around $2.5k/year per user; managed scanning services (like Qualys) might charge per IP or app - e.g., a small business might pay $5k/year for quarterly scans. RedMesh could be priced in that vicinity but deliver more (actual exploits, not just vuln scanning, plus decentralization).","OpenVAS is free if self-managed, but Greenbone’s paid plans (as cited) show that even open-source tech can be sold for a fee when packaged nicely. RedMesh’s stewards can follow a similar approach: offer a free community edition (the code on GitHub anyone can use) and a paid hosted edition with extra ease-of-use features.","In conclusion, a plausible pricing strategy is to charge in the low hundreds to low thousands of dollars per month depending on scale, which is justified by the saved effort and additional support provided. This range ensures the service is significantly cheaper than hiring equivalent human pentesters or buying closed-source platforms, reflecting the cost savings of using open source and automation. Meanwhile, it provides sustainable revenue for the providers (given that running, say, 10 nodes costs $750, charging $1500+ leaves room for salaries and profit).","Importantly, if a customer is very cost-sensitive and technically capable, they can always choose the free route - run RedMesh themselves at the baseline $75/node cost. This open-source dynamic will keep competitive pressure on any RedMesh commercial offerings. The key for providers is to justify their prices with superior convenience (user-friendly dashboards, auto updates, custom rule sets, expert reports). Many companies will gladly pay a reasonable fee to avoid the headache of DIY, as long as the pricing clearly beats older alternatives.","RedMesh enters the market as an innovative and disruptive player in penetration testing. Its decentralized, distributed architecture and open-source licensing break the mold set by traditional pentest tools and modern SaaS platforms alike. In an unbiased view, RedMesh’s strengths lie in its potential for massive scalability, continuous operation, cost efficiency, and security through decentralization. These give it an edge in scenarios where automation and coverage are paramount - for example, continuously guarding a wide attack surface or augmenting a small security team’s capabilities with an autonomous “army” of pentest agents.","At the same time, RedMesh faces formidable competition on multiple fronts. Established open-source tools like Metasploit and Burp have rich capabilities and communities (though they lack RedMesh’s distributed nature). Enterprise solutions like Pentera offer polish and support (but at high cost and without open-source transparency). Crowdsourced testing via platforms like Synack provides human ingenuity and is already delivering continuous results with global researchers. And emerging AI-driven frameworks promise to automate hacking with unprecedented speed. RedMesh will need to carve out its niche by playing to its unique combination of being open, decentralized, and secure by design.","Market positioning: RedMesh should be positioned as a platform for democratizing advanced pentesting - much like how the CAI project aims to democratize AI security testing. It can bring capabilities that were once expensive or complex (like distributed multi-node attacks, continuous monitoring, trustless coordination) into the hands of ordinary security teams. This could spur a new segment in the market: Decentralized Security Testing. If RedMesh proves effective, even competitors might adopt similar architectures, but as of now it has a first-mover advantage in that space.","Competitive outlook: In the near term, RedMesh might complement rather than replace other tools. Organizations could run RedMesh alongside vulnerability scanners (to exploit what the scanners find, or to validate patches), and use it to reduce the workload on human testers by handling the “easy” attacks automatically. Over time, if its knowledge base and AI integration grow, it could take over more of what human-led pentests do today. The open-source model means the community can drive its evolution - perhaps integrating popular offensive tools into the RedMesh node software, sharing new attack techniques, etc. This community-driven growth can be a huge competitive advantage over proprietary tools that evolve slower or are limited by vendor resources.","Pricing we discussed indicates that RedMesh-based services can be offered at a fraction of the cost of traditional pentesting engagements or commercial products, due to the minimal software licensing fees (essentially zero) and efficient use of computing resources. Our proposed ranges (roughly $100-$200/month for a small setup plus the N-ENTRY node cost of 75$, up tens of thousands for enterprise-scale use) show that a provider can monetize RedMesh by selling convenience and support, while the end customer still saves money compared to alternatives. Open source historically drives prices down and adoption up - we expect a similar pattern here, where RedMesh forces competitors to justify their premium or adopt interoperability. For instance, if RedMesh gains popularity, a company like Rapid7 (Metasploit’s owner) might consider adding distributed features, or a Synack might incorporate more automation to stay ahead.","In conclusion, RedMesh holds a promising position as a trailblazer of decentralized pentesting. Its success will depend on execution - delivering robust features and fostering a user community - and on convincing the market of the value of decentralization in security testing. If it succeeds, it could redefine how organizations conduct penetration testing, making continuous, automated, and distributed security validation a standard practice. Given the increasing emphasis on proactive cybersecurity and the need to do more with less (budget and staff), RedMesh’s timing is apt. By offering a powerful platform at low cost, it can find a strong foothold among savvy CISOs and security engineers. And even though any company can run it themselves, many will prefer to pay for a managed experience, meaning there is a viable business model around this open-source tool, as long as pricing remains competitive and transparent.","The cybersecurity market is evolving quickly - from AI “co-pilots” for hackers to collaborative human/AI services - and RedMesh’s distributed open approach is aligned with the ethos of the modern tech world (decentralization and open collaboration). Its journey will be interesting to watch, as it competes with both incumbents and new innovations. In the end, more options and lower costs for effective security testing benefit everyone (except perhaps the attackers!). RedMesh’s entry pushes the envelope, and even competitors will likely up their game in response - a win-win for the industry’s security posture.","Andrei Ionut Damian","Sep 1, 2025","‹ Ratio1 AI‑4‑Everyone (AI4E) Framework: Technical Preview","Ratio1 RedMesh: Decentralized Distributed Cybersecurity ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

Built as a core framework component part of the Ratio1 Edge Node, RedMesh enables distributed vulnerability scanning across a mesh of edge nodes. This article provides a technical and business-oriented overview of RedMesh - from how it works under the hood to its real-world applications - with insights for cybersecurity specialists and enterprise teams alike.","Ratio1 RedMesh is essentially a distributed pentesting plugin running on Ratio1 Edge Nodes. It acts as a web service managed app that accepts penetration testing jobs (targeting a given host or IP) and orchestrates their execution across multiple nodes, regions and continents. In simpler terms, RedMesh allows you to launch a security scan from one node and have that task propagated to all participating nodes in the network for parallel execution both vertical (utilizing local edge node resources) and horizontal scaling the job execution.","Open Source and Integration: RedMesh is part of the open-source Ratio1 Edge Node repository (Apache 2.0 licensed), underscoring Ratio1’s commitment to transparency and extensibility. It seamlessly integrates with the Ratio1 “DNA” framework - the Decentralized Neuro-symbolic Autonomous processing architecture - which leverages blockchain for trustless coordination and security. By running as a plugin on the Edge Node, RedMesh inherits all the privacy and security features of the Ratio1 platform (e.g. signature-based task validation and on-chain verifiability of operations, blockchain based job orchestration and execution consensus). This means pentesting tasks can be carried out in a trustless, decentralized manner without sacrificing data integrity or requiring centralized control.","Under the hood, RedMesh is implemented as a plugin class (the PentesterApi01Plugin) that extends Ratio1’s base web-app plugin. It exposes HTTP API endpoints for initiating and monitoring penetration tests. When you launch a test via the API (providing a target hostname or IP as well as a few other configurable params), the plugin based system does the following:","Network-Wide Job Announcement: The target is announced to other nodes using Ratio1’s distributed in-memory database (CStore). The plugin stores the target in a hash map (keyed by the plugin’s instance ID and the announcing node’s address) that is visible to all participating nodes on the network. By “participating jobs” we refer to the nodes that receive the RedMesh job from a valid Deeploy project launched by a R1 Cloud Service Provider. Each RedMesh-enabled node periodically checks this shared store for new targets to test. By writing the target to the chainstore, the initiating node effectively broadcasts a “pentest job” to the entire mesh of nodes.","Asynchronous Execution on Each Node: On each node (including the one that initiated the scan), RedMesh will detect the new target entry and spin up a background thread to handle the scanning workload. The plugin is designed to run jobs asynchronously so that the main node process remains responsive. In fact, the pentest plugin explicitly supports threaded execution - it launches each job in one or multiple threads for concurrency using a batch-based approach (ports batching). This means a fleet of nodes can all work on scanning the target simultaneously, without blocking their other tasks.","Coordinated Multi-Phase Scanning: Once a node picks up a pentest job, it instantiates a PentestJobHelper object (running in the thread) to perform the actual scanning. The scanning process is multi-phase, covering port discovery, service fingerprinting, and basic vulnerability tests in sequence.","Service Fingerprinting: For each open port found, RedMesh gathers service information or “banners” to identify what's running. This is done through lightweight protocol interactions. For example, it will retrieve the FTP welcome message and note if anonymous login is allowed. It grabs SSH handshake banners to get the SSH server version. It makes HTTP(S) requests to capture web server headers (status codes, Server header) and even fetches TLS certificate details (protocol, cipher, and certificate expiry) on HTTPS ports. It similarly probes SMTP (reads the SMTP server greeting) and other services, using either protocol-specific handshakes or a generic socket read for any service that returns text. This fingerprinting step enriches the port scan by telling the user what those open ports actually correspond to (e.g. “Open port 22: SSH - OpenSSH 8.4” or “Port 21: FTP server allows anonymous login”).","Basic Vulnerability Testing: If the target has any web service (eg ports 80, 443, 8080, or 8443 open), RedMesh automatically performs a series of web security checks. It will attempt to access common sensitive endpoints like /robots.txt, /.env, /.git/, /admin, /login to see if they are reachable (HTTP 200 OK) or protected (401/403). It scans the homepage HTML for leaked secrets or credentials (looking for keywords like \"API_KEY\", \"PASSWORD\", \"SECRET\", or even signs of private keys) that might indicate a misconfiguration. It examines HTTP headers for missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) and checks cookies for missing Secure/HttpOnly flags. Furthermore, RedMesh conducts simple attack probes: it tests for reflective XSS by injecting a <script>alert(1)</script> payload in a URL and seeing if it appears in the response. It checks for directory listing by detecting \"Index of /\" in responses. It tries a basic path traversal (“/../../../../etc/passwd”) to see if it can read sensitive files (looking for the presence of \"root:x:\" in the response). And it appends a SQL injection payload (?id=1' OR '1'='1) to URLs to see if any common database error messages appear in the output. These out-of-the-box tests cover a broad range of common web vulnerabilities in an automated fashion.","Completion & Result Aggregation: After port scanning is finished (no ports left unscanned) and all service info is gathered, and the web tests (if applicable) are done, the job is marked as completed. Each node then compiles a result object containing the target, the list of open ports found, and any service info or web findings gathered. Because multiple nodes may perform the scan, you effectively get multiple vantage points. Each node will mark the job done independently when its thread completes. As a final step, each node sets its entry in the chainstore back to None (to signal that it has finished the announced job). This prevents re-launching the same job again and tells other nodes that this target has been handled. From the initiating client’s perspective, one can query any node (typically the one that launched the test) for the job status and results. The get_job_status API will report whether the job is still in progress (and provide interim data like ports scanned so far, open ports found, etc.) or if it’s completed and include the final report. The response structure includes the target, status, and if completed, the report (e.g. open ports and service details) for that target.","Notably, RedMesh’s design is peer-to-peer and collaborative, thus every node running the plugin following the R1 Deeploy launch will participate in the work. This “mesh” approach to pentesting can increase both the speed of scans (many nodes dividing the work) and the coverage (multiple nodes might be located in different networks, uncovering different visibility or perspective of the target).","To summarize, here are the key features of Ratio1 RedMesh that make it a powerful tool for cybersecurity testing on a decentralized platform:","Distributed “Red Team” Operations: Leverages Ratio1’s network of Edge Nodes to perform penetration tests in a distributed manner. When a job is launched, it’s broadcast to all participating nodes via the decentralized chainstore, and each node can contribute to the scan. This mesh architecture means no single point of failure and the possibility of parallelized scanning from multiple locations.","Asynchronous, Non-Blocking Design: Each node runs scans in the background using threads, so the pentesting tasks do not block the node’s main operations or other AI workloads. This design allows continuous operation even while heavy scans are underway.","Comprehensive Port Coverage: By default, RedMesh checks a wide range of common ports and services (FTP, SSH, Telnet, SMTP, DNS, HTTP/S, SMB, databases like MySQL/MSSQL/Oracle, RDP, VNC, MongoDB, etc.). This out-of-the-box port list targets many critical services, making the scan broadly useful without custom configuration.","Service Fingerprinting and Banner Grabbing: For each open port found, the framework automatically attempts to gather identifying information. This includes grabbing text banners or protocol handshakes: e.g. FTP server greetings (and whether anonymous login is allowed), SSH version strings from the SSH daemon, SMTP welcome messages, and HTTP headers. It even inspects SSL/TLS on secure ports to report the TLS version and cipher and how long until the certificate expires. Such information is crucial for auditors (revealing outdated software versions, weak configurations, etc.).","Built-in Web Vulnerability Scanning: RedMesh performs basic web security testing on any HTTP service detected. It checks for misconfigurations (like publicly accessible config files or admin pages) and missing security headers. It also conducts simple penetration attempts such as reflected XSS detection, directory traversal file access, and SQL injection probes. While these tests are not as exhaustive as a dedicated web scanner or manual pentest, they provide quick coverage of common weaknesses without any additional setup.","Composable, configurable, plugin-based: More importantly RedMesh offers the possibility to extend all above features with additional more. At the time of writing the RedMesh internal plugin “database” already surpassed the specs and features listed above. Since the RedMesh code is open, security researchers and developers can extend it. The plugin’s modular design (using mixins for service info and web tests) makes it straightforward to add new port checks or vulnerability signatures. For example, one could add a _service_info_6379 method to better handle Redis (port 6379) - which the framework already partially implements - or include additional web tests for other vulnerabilities. This flexibility means RedMesh can evolve quickly with community contributions, potentially keeping pace with emerging threats. For businesses, this openness provides confidence (you can inspect exactly what the scanner is doing) and the ability to customize the tool to specific needs.","Real-Time Status and Results API: All interactions with RedMesh are via API endpoints, making it easy to integrate with other tools or dashboards. You can trigger a test and then poll for status. The status includes ongoing progress (how many ports scanned, which found open, etc.) while running, and a final report upon completion that lists discovered open ports and gathered info. This real-time feedback is useful in practice - e.g., a security engineer could launch a scan and start seeing open ports detected within seconds, then get the full results when done.","Security and Privacy Controls: Because RedMesh runs on the Ratio1 platform, it benefits from the ecosystem’s security model. Only authorized parties (with the appropriate token or permissions) can launch scans on a node - nodes will reject commands from unknown sources, thanks to Ratio1’s decentralized authentication and whitelist mechanism (each node owner can control who is allowed to submit jobs). Furthermore, results are stored in the CStore decentralized in-memory database and only shared via the API to the requester, preserving privacy. All network communication can be verified or encrypted, and thanks to Ratio1’s blockchain integration, operations can be audit-trailed if needed.","All information regarding jobs, launch, participating nodes are immutably written in the Base L2 public blockchain (ETH L2). This is especially important given the potentially sensitive nature of pentesting data.","From a business perspective, Ratio1 RedMesh opens up interesting new possibilities by combining cybersecurity with decentralized edge computing:","Continuous and Distributed Security Monitoring: Companies can deploy multiple Ratio1 Edge Nodes (e.g., on-premises, in different cloud regions, at partner sites) and run RedMesh on all of them. They could then schedule periodic scans of their critical assets. Because the scans are distributed, you get a form of “continuous automated red teaming” from various network vantage points. For instance, an organization could scan an internal web application from both inside its network and an external node simultaneously to compare findings (internal nodes might see things external scanners can’t, and vice versa). This improves coverage and can catch misconfigurations that only manifest under certain network conditions.","Pentesting-as-a-Service Networks: The RedMesh framework hints at a future where independent node operators could contribute to security testing tasks and be rewarded for it. Ratio1’s platform already includes an $R1 token economy for computing tasks, and a similar model could apply to security scans. An enterprise could broadcast a pentest job onto the Ratio1 network (encrypted and controlled, of course) and offer token incentives for nodes to participate in the scan. The result is a crowdsourced pentest facilitated by technology - faster and potentially more cost-effective than hiring a single external team for a one-time test. Because all actions can be logged on-chain and results verified, there’s an audit trail for compliance. This approach could augment traditional security audits with more continuous, decentralized scrutiny.","Enhanced Testing Realism: In red team vs. blue team scenarios, RedMesh can be a tremendous boon for the red team side. Instead of launching attacks from a single machine or location, a red team can easily use RedMesh to launch multi-origin attacks. Imagine testing a company’s geo-distributed intrusion detection by launching the scan from nodes on different continents at once - RedMesh makes that feasible with minimal coordination overhead. It essentially provides a ready-made “botnet” of friendly nodes for your testing (all running the exact same toolset and in a controlled manner). For the blue team (defenders), knowing that such tools exist is equally valuable: they can simulate distributed attack patterns and ensure their monitoring and response tactics can handle them.","Integration with DevSecOps Pipelines: Because RedMesh is accessible via API and can be automated, it can integrate with CI/CD or DevSecOps workflows. For example, after deploying a new version of an application to a staging environment, a security pipeline could trigger RedMesh scans against that environment’s URL. Within minutes, the development team would get a report of any obvious vulnerabilities or open services they might have inadvertently exposed. This kind of automated feedback loop helps catch issues early, complementing other tools like static code analysis or container vulnerability scans. The fact that RedMesh runs on the same Ratio1 nodes that might also be hosting AI microservices or other apps means security testing becomes a built-in part of the application runtime environment.","Trust and Transparency: Using an open source security tool increases trust for businesses. RedMesh’s code can be reviewed to ensure it’s safe and does only what is intended (no backdoors, no data exfiltration beyond the scan results). In industries with strict compliance (finance, healthcare), having an auditable and on-premises option for security scanning is a big advantage. An organization could run their own Ratio1 nodes with RedMesh internally (no external dependency) if they want full control, effectively turning RedMesh into an internal security scanner that still benefits from the distributed design (if they run multiple nodes at various offices, for instance). Meanwhile, the blockchain-backed verification of actions means any critical operations (like a scan of a sensitive asset) could be recorded immutably, providing assurance that tests were performed and by whom - useful for compliance reports and post-mortem analysis.","RedMesh is a powerful showcase of Ratio1’s broader platform capabilities. Ratio1’s vision is to democratize AI and computing by leveraging decentralized, blockchain-powered edge networks. Key aspects of the Ratio1 ecosystem, such as its trustless coordination and economic incentives, are exemplified in RedMesh:","Decentralization & Trustless Coordination: The use of the chainstore (a decentralized key-value store) for coordination in RedMesh demonstrates how Ratio1 enables trustless collaboration. Nodes do not need to trust each other or a central server to participate in a pentest job - the shared ledger/store ensures each node sees the same announced task and can contribute. This same pattern is used in Ratio1 for scheduling AI tasks or data processing jobs across nodes. In RedMesh, it ensures no single node has to bear all the load and results can be cross-verified if needed (multiple nodes doing the same scan can validate each other’s findings).","Blockchain Security & Identity: Every Ratio1 node has its own cryptographic identity (with an associated blockchain address). This means actions like launching a pentest job can be tied to a specific identity and even signed as transactions. Although RedMesh’s current implementation allows launching jobs via API calls, one can imagine integrating it with Ratio1’s on-chain governance or permission system - e.g., only authorized security engineers’ blockchain accounts are whitelisted to trigger scans on a given node (which is aligned with Ratio1’s whitelist approach for task submission). All operations being verifiable on-chain adds a layer of tamper-resistance. For example, a malicious actor cannot stealthily trigger scans on your node without leaving a trace. This intersection of blockchain and cybersecurity is where Ratio1 stands out from conventional platforms.","Resource Incentivization: Ratio1’s token-driven model (using the R1 utility token for rewarding resource providers) could directly apply to RedMesh. Nodes contributing to a large scan could earn tokens proportional to their work. This incentivizes a robust network of “security worker” nodes. In effect, Ratio1 could foster a marketplace for security testing - much like how its core design fosters a marketplace for AI computation. Businesses benefit by paying only for results, and node operators benefit by monetizing idle compute time through performing security scans. The open-source nature of RedMesh means any improvements or new test modules added by one party can benefit the whole community, accelerating innovation in the security testing space.","Versatility of the Edge Node platform: RedMesh running on the same Edge Node that might run AI workloads (for example, machine learning inference or data analysis) is a testament to Ratio1’s versatility. It blurs the line between AI operations and IT operations. A single node can contribute to a neural network computation one moment and a network security scan the next. This is particularly appealing to small companies or teams that might not afford dedicated security infrastructure - their existing Ratio1 nodes can double as security scanners when not busy with AI tasks. The meta-OS nature of Ratio1’s Edge Node means it can host diverse “apps” (plugins) from analytics to cybersecurity within the same distributed environment.","Privacy-Preserving Collaboration: In scenarios where multiple organizations want to collaborate on security (for instance, an ISAC - Information Sharing and Analysis Center - where members jointly scan and share threat intel), RedMesh on Ratio1 could serve as the underlying tech. Each organization runs a node; a coordinator triggers a scan job for a common threat target (say analyzing a malicious infrastructure). Because of Ratio1’s privacy-preserving design, each org’s data and environment remain isolated (the scan results on each node are only shared as intended), yet they collectively contribute to a broader security goal. This showcases how Ratio1’s principles can extend to collaborative cybersecurity efforts without centralized control.","Ratio1 RedMesh represents an innovative fusion of decentralized technology and cybersecurity. By embedding a penetration testing framework into a blockchain-powered edge computing network, Ratio1 has enabled a “Red Team Mesh” that can be safer, faster, and more resilient than traditional approaches. Technically, RedMesh provides a clear API and a robust scanning engine covering network and web layers, all running across potentially many nodes in parallel. For security professionals, it’s a new tool that can augment how we approach vulnerability assessment - bringing the benefits of distributed systems to what has traditionally been a centralized task.","From a business angle, RedMesh highlights how the Ratio1 platform isn’t just about AI; it’s about autonomous, decentralized computing for any purpose, including security. Organizations stand to gain from this by improving their security posture (through continuous, diverse-angle testing) and potentially reducing costs (via automation and resource sharing). The fact that RedMesh is open source means it will evolve with community input, and its alignment with Ratio1’s blockchain ethos means we can expect features like on-chain result verification, reward mechanisms, and enhanced privacy controls to strengthen over time.","In summary, Ratio1 RedMesh turns the concept of a penetration test into a distributed application - one that embodies the Ratio1 values of decentralization, trustlessness, and collaboration. It’s an exciting development not only for the Ratio1 community but also for the cybersecurity field, which is always seeking new ways to stay ahead of threats. With RedMesh now publicly available, we encourage developers and security experts to explore the repository, try running a node with RedMesh, and even contribute to its capabilities. This could very well be the start of a new era of pentesting - one powered by a mesh of nodes working autonomously yet collectively, secured by blockchain and driven by AI-era compute infrastructure. The Red Team now has a Mesh, and it’s open for everyone to join or deploy.","Andrei Ionut Damian","Aug 29, 2025","‹ RedMesh: Market Analysis and Positioning vs. Competitors","Readme ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

It consists of two companion apps: the AI4E Creation Toolkit (a wizard-driven mobile app creator) and AI4E LabelCraft (a crowdsourced data-labeling app). The Creation Toolkit guides the user through each step of an ML pipeline - from defining the app and data to deploying a trained model and “attaching” that model serving backed to a pre-defined user interface from a given set of templates - while LabelCraft engages volunteers to annotate data for training. Crucially, both tools leverage blockchain-based smart contracts: when a user launches a project, on-chain transactions automatically fund the labeling and training processes. This makes the pipeline transparent and self‑contained, with rewards paid out in R1 tokens while the funds are temporally stored throughout the job lifecycle in stablecoin in order to protect all participants to any volatility related risks. (In fact, our roadmap explicitly calls the Creation Toolkit a “low-code toolkit [that] helps users build AI applications” and LabelCraft an “AI4E data-labeling tool”.)","This article presents the pre-beta versions of the AI4E Creation Toolkit (R1-5) and LabelCraft (R1-158).","The AI4E Creation Toolkit is a mobile app (Android/iOS) that functions like a wizard or guided assistant for building computer-vision applications. In a sequence of simple screens, the user specifies the AI use case and data, and the Toolkit handles the rest. For example, the steps might include:","Select an application type: The user chooses what kind of computer-vision app to build (e.g. image classifier, object detector, OCR reader). The toolkit may offer single-stage vs. multi-stage pipelines (single-stage might be a one-shot model like YOLO that might need specific training for a particular set of target object detection classes, while multi-stage could mean detect-then-classify, etc.).","Select what data should be extracted and how it should be used. The user is guided to explain exactly what the models are looking for (i.e. must detect a particular object in an image or must identify if a log line looks suspicious). This will be further used in the following two data prep steps.","Provide or specify data sources: The user links the dataset that the model will train on (e.g. upload images from device, connect a cloud photo album, or link to a public dataset URL)","Launch labeling workflow: If needed, the Toolkit automatically kicks off a labeling campaign by sending the raw data to the LabelCraft community (see next section).","Monitor model training: Once labels are collected, the Toolkit starts model training (on-device or in the cloud) and shows real-time progress/status to the user.","Configure model serving: After training, the Toolkit provisions a backend to serve the model. It might spin up a container or cloud function to host the model for inference.","Attach a user interface: Finally, the trained model is connected to a simple front-end. The Toolkit provides a predefined UI template (for example, a mobile app screen or web demo) and wires it up to the new model so the user has an end-to-end working app with minimal coding.","Each bullet above is guided by the app’s wizard UI, with clear prompts and presets. The user never has to write code: instead the Toolkit invokes underlying ML tools and infrastructure. Under the hood, it uses established libraries (PyTorch being the default but Tensorflow is also possible) to train as well as serve (via our Torchscript based serving backend). For large jobs, training may occur based on a decentralized setting using Ratio1 decentralized federated learning EDIL framework that also includes homomorphic encryption approaches (via pre-trained or few-shot trained autoencoders used for embedding generation). In such a scheme, raw data stays on users’ devices, enhancing privacy, while model updates are shared and merged (and contributors are rewarded).","Throughout this process, the Creation Toolkit remains user-friendly and low-code. The Ratio1 roadmap explicitly describes it as a “low-code toolkit” to help anyone build AI apps. The app’s interface would show progress bars and simple forms instead of code. For example, when it “sets up the backend,” the user might just tap a button saying “Deploy”, while the system configures a server or container behind the scenes. All technical complexity (data pipelines, model selection, hyperparameters, container orchestration) is managed automatically. In short, the AI4E Creation Toolkit wraps the entire ML lifecycle - data collection, annotation, training, and deployment - into a step-by-step mobile wizard.","The AI4E LabelCraft app is the crowdsourcing engine that powers the Creation Toolkit’s training data needs. It is a mobile app that any volunteer can install to help label data in exchange for rewards. LabelCraft provides a list of available annotation jobs (for example, “draw bounding boxes around cars in these images” or “label the following videos with activity tags”). The interface is gamified: it makes labeling easy and rewarding, much like a game or quiz. For each task, LabelCraft might show simple tools (tap to tag, draw a box, select a category) and submit results in one tap.","Importantly, LabelCraft incentivizes users with rewards. This follows emerging trends in decentralized AI - turns data labeling into a game where users “monetize their spare time” by completing tasks without requiring technical expertise. To ensure quality, the system can require multiple users to label the same item or use algorithmic checks.","In summary, LabelCraft turns data annotation into a community activity: anyone can contribute to training datasets through a user-friendly mobile interface and earn crypto for it. The collected labels automatically feed back into the Creation Toolkit’s pipeline, supplying the “ground truth” needed to train the user’s custom model.","A defining feature of AI4E is on-chain orchestration. When a creator begins an AI project in the Creation Toolkit, the app creates or interacts with a smart contract on the Ratio1 blockchain. The user deposits tokens into this contract to fund the upcoming labeling and training / serving tasks. Smart contracts then automate payments to LabelCraft annotators and to compute providers as milestones are reached. For example: once enough labels are gathered and verified, the contract releases payment to those labelers; once the model finishes training with acceptable accuracy, the contract releases payment to the node that performed the training or returns remaining funds to the project owner. This approach ensures transparency and trustlessness: everyone can verify on-chain how many tasks were issued and paid for.","Key aspects of this blockchain integration include:","On-Chain Funding: Project creators allocate tokens via a smart contract to pay for labeling and training. This contract governs the workflow (for example, “once 10,000 labels are submitted, pay out $X to labelers; once model accuracy ≥ Y%, pay out $Z to the trainer”).","Automated Rewards: LabelCraft annotators automatically receive tokens for each completed task. For example, when a label is verified as correct, the smart contract credits the user’s redeemable amount.","Transparent Tracking: Every labeling and training task is logged on the blockchain. Creators can inspect the ledger to see which tasks were done and ensure fair payment.","Secure Model Deployment: Once training is done, the model is deployed. The smart contract can signal to a hosting platform (possibly a decentralized server network) to serve the model for inference. The frontend UI (attached by the Toolkit) then connects to this backend. In some designs, even model downloads or updates could be managed by on-chain cues.","In essence, AI4E’s blockchain layer removes middlemen and automates billing. The user of the Creation Toolkit doesn’t manually handle invoices or invoices; instead, they use crypto transactions to pay for the crowdsourced work. This aligns with other “AI for Everyone” visions where democratizing AI goes hand in hand with decentralized finance models.","In summary, the AI4E Creation Toolkit and LabelCraft form a complete pipeline for non-experts to launch custom AI solutions. The wizard guides users from app concept to a working model, while the LabelCraft community and on-chain contracts handle data labeling and model training. This community-driven, blockchain-funded approach is designed to make AI development broadly accessible - truly putting AI “for everyone”.","Andrei Ionut Damian","Sep 2, 2025","‹ Deeploy Unlocked: Accessing the Power of Ratio1","RedMesh: Market Analysis and Positioning vs. Competitors ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

Instead of Ratio1 directly chasing end-users, CSPs act as the bridge - thriving on Ratio1’s capabilities while delivering services to their clients.","To make this vision a reality, we built the Deeploy App (R1-301): a simple yet powerful gateway that gives CSPs seamless access to Ratio1’s distributed computing power.","One of the strengths of Ratio1 is its openness. Almost anyone can become a CSP.","At present, the requirements are:","Owning a Node Deed / Master Node Deed License linked to an Oracle Node","Passing the KYC/KYB verification process","Without a licensed Oracle Node, a user cannot interact with the Deeploy App, since the app communicates with the Deeploy API through these nodes.","This article is written both for those just curious about Ratio1, and for those seriously considering stepping into the role of a CSP.","Think of the Deeploy App as Ratio1’s control center for CSPs.","It is a continuously evolving application that already comes with pre-built deployment templates for:","Generic applications","Common services","Native apps","And this is just the beginning. As CSPs and their clients demand more, the template library will expand to cover new use cases - ensuring that no workload is left unsupported.","To step into the role of a CSP, a Node Operator must apply to become both an Oracle Operator and a CSP. It’s important to note that once a Node is turned into an Oracle, its license will not directly run jobs, meaning it will not receive Proof of AI rewards from job execution. Instead, its role is to mediate and interact with the Deeploy API.","When a CSP logs in for the first time at deeploy.ratio1.ai, they are prompted to deploy their CSP Smart Contract.","This step is foundational:","Every CSP owns their own smart contract","All CSP activity is traceable on-chain","Deployments remain transparent and independent","In other words: your business as a CSP runs on infrastructure you fully control, with accountability baked in. More information on this subject will be provided in the below “behind the scenes” chapter of this article.","Once a CSP has a smart contract, they can begin by creating projects. A project can consist of one or many jobs - for example:","A dApp","A CMS application","A database cluster","This project-based structure keeps things neat, organized, and scalable.","Before starting a job within a project, CSPs must first create a tunnel.","Why? Because tunnels establish secure communication between applications and the Ratio1 infrastructure. They’re created and managed directly in the Tunnels section of the Deeploy App.","To enable this, CSPs simply connect their Cloudflare credentials, allowing the CSP to create and manage Cloudflare Tunnels directly from the Deeploy App.","This modular setup ensures that even complex, multi-job deployments remain flexible, secure, and manageable.","The actual job deployment journey looks like this:","Create a project and add jobs inside it.","Choose a job type from templates (Generic App, Service, or Native App).","Specify machine requirements - with or without GPU, and the number of nodes.","Apply filters for node selection. Currently, only the KYB label is supported (ensuring Node Operators are verified companies), but more labels are coming soon (e.g., Dora compliance, geographic location, and industry standards).","Review job specs & pricing - including run time.","Fill deployment information - environment variables, ports, image links.","Finalize and pay - lock USDC into the escrow smart contract to confirm deployment.","At this point, the job is officially on Ratio1.To make onboarding even easier, we’ve created a step-by-step end-to-end application deployment tutorial. This guide walks CSPs through the full process inside the Deeploy App - from creating a project and setting up tunnels, to configuring jobs, locking funds, and launching workloads on Ratio1. Whether you’re new to decentralized compute or an experienced operator, the tutorial ensures you can move from zero to live deployment with confidence.","Watch the full tutorial here:Link","The Deeploy workflow brings together two layers: off-chain processing handled by the Ratio1 oracle network, and on-chain execution secured by smart contracts. The oracle network takes care of receiving, validating, and launching jobs, while the escrow system ensures that funds are safely locked for the duration of the job (or for the portion already paid). On-chain consensus then guarantees that every job transition is recorded and tamper-proof - for instance, when a worker drops a job and it is instantly reassigned, or when the system scales horizontally by adjusting the number of replicas. This design ensures transparency, immutable records, secure transactions, and budgets that can always be verified.","Your path as a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) begins by building reputation within the network and having one of your nodes granted \"oracle status\" - a step that, for now, only the Ratio1 team can approve. Once your node becomes an Oracle, you gain access to the Deeploy App, where you will deploy your own CSP Escrow Smart Contract. This contract securely holds the funds committed to job execution and releases them gradually to the participating Node Operators.","For the oracles network to accept and start a job through Deeploy, each workload needs to lock the expected budget inside a verifiable smart contract, so that every oracle knows the payout is guaranteed before allocating compute. This is why we developed CSP Escrow Smart Contracts, implemented with the Beacon Proxy pattern: the CSP is the on-chain owner of its escrow instance for creating jobs, topping up balances, and adjusting replicas, while the Ratio1-owned beacon guards upgrades and protocol rules across all escrows.","How this works:","- Each escrow deployment mints a dedicated contract instance initialised with the CSP address as `cspOwner`. Only this address can call job lifecycle methods such as `createJobs`, `extendJobDuration`, or `extendJobNodes`, keeping economic control in the CSP's hands.","- Consensus-sensitive operations remain delegated to the PoAI Manager (`PoAIManager.sol`). Only the manager can write oracle observations on-chain (`updateActiveNodes`) or trigger epoch distributions (`allocateRewardsToNodes`), ensuring that no single CSP can bypass multi-oracle agreement.","- During every allocation cycle the contract separates the job budget into rewards and a protocol burn: 85% is queued for node operators, 15% is swapped to R1 and burned, meaning each CSP contributes to the long-term health of the token economy.","- Rewards are tracked per node inside the escrow (`virtualWalletBalance`). Node Owners claim them via the PoAI Manager, which swaps the accumulated USDC to R1 and transfers the tokens on-chain, providing auditable settlement for every epoch.","- Safeguards such as balance checks, per-epoch accounting, and the ability for the manager to reconcile jobs ensure Node Providers cannot be short-changed, even if a CSP fails to extend or close jobs on time.","- Jobs are always pre-funded: `createJobs` multiplies the catalogued price-per-epoch by the number of requested replicas and prepaid epochs (minimum 30), instantly transferring the matching USDC into escrow so capital is locked before a single container launches.","ChainDist is the glue between what Deeploy launches off-chain and what the smart contracts recognise on-chain. The `chain_dist_monitor.py` service runs on every oracle node, continuously syncing local telemetry with contract state to keep the Ratio1 network honest.","It orchestrates a set of consensus-driven loops:","- Validation loop: Oracles pull the list of unvalidated jobs from the PoAI Manager (`get_unvalidated_job_ids`) and compare it with the workloads they see running. Only when at least one third of oracles report the same node set does the manager persist that view via `submitNodeUpdate`, aligning the escrow `activeNodes` with reality.","- Closure loop: When a job budget is exhausted, oracles coordinate to tear it down. Each monitor queries `get_first_closable_job_id` to agree on the next job that should be sunset, waits a randomised backoff, removes workloads from the network, and submits an empty node list on-chain so the job is marked closed and funds stop streaming out.","- Rewards loop: After each epoch ends, monitors stagger calls to `allocate_rewards_across_all_escrows()`. The PoAI Manager iterates through every escrow, moving accrued balances to node wallets and enforcing the burn. If an oracle misses its slot, others can finalise the distribution, preserving liveness.","- Availability loop: `check_all_active_jobs` continuously reconciles every running job, stops any extra nodes that are executing workloads without being on the paid roster, and redeploys replicas on healthy nodes whenever a worker disappears, keeping applications highly available.","Under the hood the monitor cross-references on-chain data with the live fleet: it inspects the applications each node advertises (`network_known_apps`) to build the canonical worker set, converts those identifiers into Ethereum addresses with `node_address_to_eth_address`, and only then votes on consensus. The same map powers safeguards such as `get_first_closable_job_id` queries, automated pipeline removals, and proactive job restarts, ensuring node providers are never left running unpaid workloads while customers retain the capacity they purchased. Consensus thresholds are explicit: more than half the active oracles must submit a view before PoAI Manager evaluates proposals, and one third plus one matching submissions is required before the contract mutates state.","Because each of these loops settles with an on-chain transaction, oracle operators need to keep a buffer of ETH in their nodes to pay gas for validation votes, closures, and reward allocation calls - participating in consensus without it would stall the network. Reminder: each individual node has its own private EVM key and thus each individual wallet with Base L2 accessible funds.","By combining deterministic contracts with this off-chain consensus mesh, Deeploy keeps job assignments, payouts, burns, and jobs status in sync across the entire network.","Ratio1 is designed as an open ecosystem. On GitHub, CSPs can find:","Deployment templates","Service adapters","Best practices for secure and scalable deployments","That means both developers as well as CSPs are able to deploy both 3rd party applications but also applications and frameworks developed by Ratio1 Community for various purposes - from cybersecurity to computer vision, from sensor network monitoring to decentralized private storage. Community contributions continuously enrich the protocol - expanding what CSPs can offer their clients.","For CSPs:","A one-stop gateway to onboard, deploy, and manage jobs","On-chain accountability through CSP smart contracts","New revenue opportunities through the Ratio1 economy","For Clients:","Access to a growing network of providers","Transparent, verifiable deployments","Proof of computation integrity","For the Ecosystem:","Expanding marketplace of applications","Stronger decentralization by lowering CSP entry barriers","A thriving protocol economy powered by real workloads","The Deeploy App is just the beginning.

We also completed a second cloud migration onto Ratio1 and brought two new applications online on the network. In parallel, we released the RedMesh framework (an open-source pilot for distributed penetration testing) and kicked off several education initiatives: our official TikTok channel now offers bite-size Ratio1 tutorials, and we launched the first Ratio1 Courses (e.g. Data Literacy for non-engineers). Developer tools also advanced: we introduced J33VES, an open-weight agents framework  (with a first pilot deployed at our already existing partner Keysoft), and made progress on the AI-4-Everyone toolkit - rolling out pre-beta versions of the low-code Creation Toolkit application creation wizard and LabelCraft data-labeling tool.","In August we finalized major roadmap items (R1-301, R1-302, R1-342). Deeploy v1 was released on mainnet with a full web UI/UX, making container deployment on Ratio1 far more user-friendly (as planned in our August roadmap). Meanwhile, in conjunction with Deeploy, Proof-of-AI went fully live: our dual-consensus system now rewards AI compute work with R1 tokens while keeping job funds in stablecoin escrows. We deployed the on-chain PoAI escrow contracts so that consumer payments for AI jobs are already running and held securely on-chain until work completes each individual epoch. These upgrades complete the foundation for a cloud-native AI OS on Ratio1 - as noted in July, by August PoAI would be “fully live” and a second migrated app would be under our belt.","Read more","August delivered on our promise to bring real-world workloads onto Ratio1. We finished a second cloud migration (R1-294), moving another enterprise application stack (previously on AWS) into our decentralized platform.

In addition, two new decentralized applications were deployed by partners on the network (complementing our early R1 Drive demo from July). These deployments validate the Ratio1 platform as a drop-in replacement for traditional cloud hosting while at the same time showcasing some of the decentralized/distributed features available cross-platform way beyond the Ratio1 python-native application. Finally, we partnered with Build21 and KeySoft (both fully migrated in July) as early testbeds, and KeySoft in particular leveraged J33VES for their MVP version of their Rapid Application Development system for financial application that now uses natural language for application creation, querying or just simple specialized and localized private agents.","We continued to expand our developer toolkit.

Following the alpha release of the RedMesh framework and the preview of AI-for-Everyone, we’re turning our attention to an extremely sensitive domain - one where our core ethos, Your AI, your Data, is paramount: healthcare. Our latest initiative in this space is CerviSafe, a decentralized, privacy-preserving AI framework for cervical cancer screening. The proof-of-concept (PoC) for CerviSafe has officially been added to our September roadmap (R1-445), marking a key milestone in demonstrating how privacy-first, edge-enabled AI can transform global health access.","Cervical cancer remains a preventable yet deadly disease, especially in low-resource regions. Early detection through screening can save lives. In practice, one key step is identifying the cervix’s transformation zone (TZ) type from a visual exam - a task requiring expertise. Women with a “Type 1” cervix (fully visible TZ) can usually be cleared with routine procedures, whereas “Type 2” or “Type 3” cervixes need more intensive follow-up. Unfortunately, many clinics in underserved areas lack the time or specialists to make these classifications, resulting in missed opportunities for life-saving intervention. Similarly, visually detecting precancerous lesions during screening is challenging and subjective, contributing to variability in care.","Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising assistive tool here. Modern AI vision models can learn to classify TZ types as well as detect (i.e. classify) suspicious lesions on cervical images, potentially standardizing care and expanding access. In fact, research shows that AI algorithms can outperform traditional HPV tests and pap smears in identifying cervical precancers from images. To accelerate such innovations, organizations like IARC are curating large cervical image datasets - e.g. an ongoing image bank of over 56,000 cervix images open to researchers worldwide.","However, deploying AI for cervical screening at scale also raises practical and ethical challenges. How do we bring powerful models to remote clinics and mobile devices? How do we ensure patient data privacy when aggregating sensitive medical images for model training? And can we prove trustworthiness of AI recommendations in a clinical setting? At Ratio1.ai, we have built a solution addressing these challenges: a decentralized AI training pipeline for cervical cancer prevention that keeps “Your AI, your Data” at its core. In this post, we outline how our approach - combining homomorphic encryption, decentralized federated learning, and private decentralized storage - enables mobile-friendly AI for classifying transformation zone types and lesions, all while preserving privacy and trust through blockchain technology.","“...democratize AI for cervical cancer prevention - giving clinics, clinicians, medical personnel and also non-medical people a tool to classify TZ type and detect lesions on the spot and more importantly on the edge…”","Implementing cervical cancer screening in low-resource settings faces several hurdles:","Limited Specialist Access: Trained colposcopists or cytologists are scarce in many regions. Visual screening methods like VIA (visual inspection with acetic acid) have subjective results and variable accuracy, especially when providers lack experience. Transformation zone classification and lesion recognition can be inconsistent, leading to missed lesions or unnecessary referrals.","Data and Privacy Concerns: AI models improve with data, but medical images are sensitive. Clinics and hospitals are often reluctant to share patient data with third-party AI services or central cloud servers due to privacy regulations (e.g. HIPAA, GDPR) and patient trust issues. A traditional approach of uploading thousands of cervical images to a cloud for AI training or inference is risky for privacy and may be infeasible in places with poor connectivity.","Infrastructure Gaps: Rural clinics may not have reliable internet or advanced hardware. Solutions must run on low-powered devices (even phones or small edge computers) and handle intermittent connectivity. Moreover, many projects remain pilot-stage because scaling out an AI system to numerous dispersed sites is complex if it relies on centralized computing.","Our mission was to democratize AI for cervical cancer prevention - giving clinics, clinicians, medical personnel and also non-medical people a tool to classify TZ type and detect lesions on the spot and more importantly on the edge, without surrendering control of their data. To do this, we leveraged Ratio1’s decentralized AI platform principles: “Your AI, Your Data” ownership via R1FS, an Encrypted Decentralized Inference and Learning (EDIL) framework for training on encrypted data, a network of edge nodes for local processing, and blockchain-based orchestration for trust and transparency. All components are built with open-source models and standards, so researchers and developers can freely build upon or integrate them into real-world solutions.","A cornerstone of our approach is ensuring that clinics and users retain full ownership of their data. Ratio1’s answer is R1FS, our private, IPFS-based file storage system integrated with the Ratio1 network. R1FS allows data to be stored and shared in a fully decentralized manner, with no single server holding all the information. All files are encrypted with keys owned by the user or node, so no central entity ever sees raw patient images - enabling a truly “Your AI, your Data” paradigm.","In the context of our cervical screening pipeline, each participating clinic or individual or node keeps its own cervix images (and any annotations) in its local R1FS storage. When the AI model needs to train or update, the raw images never leave the premises. Instead, what gets shared are securely derived data artifacts (more on this below) or model parameters - and even those are exchanged through R1FS in an encrypted form. R1FS acts as a peer-to-peer data backbone for our federated learning: multiple nodes can publish and retrieve shared model updates or results, with content addressing (via R1FS/IPFS CIDs) ensuring the right data finds the right nodes. Crucially, this happens without exposing any private images or requiring a central database. As our developers describe it, “Multiple nodes can securely exchange partial model weights or aggregated learning statistics via R1FS, ensuring each node’s raw data remains private. This opens doors for collaborative machine learning projects across different organizations without compromising individual data sovereignty”. In short, R1FS gives us a decentralized data layer where clinics collaborate on AI while each retains control over its sensitive data.","“...no central entity ever sees raw patient images  enabling a truly “Your AI, your Data” paradigm…”","With EDIL, all training computations occur on encrypted or encoded data, so that nodes (and even the coordinating server, if one existed) never see each other’s raw inputs. Our Ratio1 EDIL framework leverages advances in homomorphic encryption and secure distributed computing to keep data encrypted end-to-end during training. “Our Ratio1 EDIL framework enables homomorphic encrypted learning and serving, allowing computations on encrypted data without ever exposing the raw inputs,” as noted in our whitepaper. This means even if multiple hospitals are training a model together, each image remains encrypted (or transformed in a one-way fashion resulting in a lower dimensionality image embedding) when it’s being processed by the AI. Traditional methods would require decrypting data at some point for model training - a vulnerable step. By contrast, our approach uses DFHE (Decentralized/Fully Homomorphic Encryption) mechanics to keep data encrypted throughout the entire training process, greatly reducing exposure risk. This is achieved via the “Domain Auto-Encoder” strategy within EDIL. Before data leaves a node (for aggregation or for another node’s computation), it’s passed through a trained (few shot or pre-trained for similar domains) auto-encoder that compresses and scrambles essential features of the image. This encoder is specific to the problem domain (in this case, cervix images) and acts as a one-way transformation - much like a specialized cipher for images. The Ratio1 training coordinator can then use these encoded features to assemble a global model update, without ever needing to decrypt them back into the original image pixels. Each node’s contribution is effectively an encrypted puzzle piece**: useful for model training when combined, but meaningless if intercepted in isolation. This strategy strikes a balance between secrecy and practicality, reducing the heavy computational overhead of purely homomorphic operations by working on lower-dimensional encoded data.","A big advantage of Ratio1’s decentralized design is that AI doesn’t live in a cloud data center - it lives on the “edge” nodes. An edge node in Ratio1 can be any machine from a cloud VM to a hospital’s local server, a laptop, or even a mobile device (within a specific set of compatible devices). This is particularly important for bringing AI assistance to remote and resource-limited settings. Our Ratio1 Edge Node (REN) software can turn heterogeneous hardware into part of the AI network: “Ratio1 Edge Nodes (REN) transform heterogeneous devices - ranging from desktops and servers to mobile and virtual instances - into secure, remotely managed compute units.” In practical terms, a rural health post could run a Ratio1 edge node on a modest PC or an arm64 device with or without an attached mobile colposcope.","In healthcare, trust and accountability are paramount. Both clinicians and patients need confidence that the AI system is secure, has not been tampered with, and operates under agreed policies. Here, Ratio1’s use of blockchain provides a unique advantage. All our training and inference workflows are underpinned by a permissioned, yet trustless network architecture.","“...only permissioned nodes (e.g. legitimate clinics, operators, individuals, etc) participate, every action is verified in a trustless manner, and the history of model training and usage is tamper-proof with immutable trace…”","To ensure only authorized participants (e.g. certified clinics, vetted research partners) can join the training network, Ratio1 uses a Node Deed licensing mechanism. A Node Deed is a non-fungible token (NFT) that grants a node permission to participate. Only nodes presenting a valid deed can contribute data or receive jobs. This keeps bad actors out and enforces a level of governance - essentially a membership system for the decentralized network. The Node Deeds are tied to real-world identity (through a KYC’d or KYB’d wallet) and a specific node instance, providing clear traceability of which organization operated which node.","Even with permissioned entry, we don’t want to have to trust any single node or even a central authority. Ratio1 employs an adaptive Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus (OracleSync and ChainDist) across special oracle nodes to validate every important action in the network. The oracle network gathers job execution and even overall node behaviour information and reaches consensus (using a aPBFT algorithm) to confirm the results before accepting them. This means the system can detect malicious or malfunctioning nodes (e.g. sending bad model updates, serving invalid inferences, etc) and ignore them, without a centralized moderator. All node states and outputs are verified in a decentralized, tamper-evident way - truly trustless in the sense that participants don’t need to blindly trust each other or a cloud service; the network rules and cryptography enforce honesty.","Every training round, model aggregation, and even dataset usage can be recorded as a transaction on the Ratio1 blockchain (or an internal ledger). The platform logs each task (job) assignment, start, and completion immutably on-chain, providing full traceability and auditability. In practice, this means we have a verifiable log of how a particular cervical screening model was trained, even which data sources contributed (in an anonymized way), what parameters changed, and whether a mission had a specific record or number or patients. If a regulatory body or hospital review board wants to audit the AI’s development, we can point to an immutable record of the training operations. Even for individual predictions, blockchain logging can trace which node handled an inference and confirm it ran the approved model version, etc. This level of transparency, secured through blockchain, helps build trust in the AI system’s integrity. It also aligns with medical data governance - any access or computation on sensitive data is tracked in a ledger that cannot be altered retrospectively, reducing the risk of undisclosed data tampering.","In summary, blockchain integration adds a layer of security and trust on top of our decentralized AI: only permissioned nodes (e.g. legitimate clinics, operators, individuals, etc) participate, every action is verified in a trustless manner, and the history of model training and usage is tamper-proof with immutable traces. This gives peace of mind to stakeholders that the AI was built and is operating under robust oversight, despite being decentralized.","True to Ratio1’s philosophy, our cervical screening AI pipeline is built with open-source tools, models and pipelines. Making our pipeline open source means anyone can spin up their own instance - commercial or otherwise - or contribute to its improvement. A university research group could fork our code to experiment with a new model for lesion detection. A healthcare startup in another country could build on our pipeline to develop a localized cervical screening app, plugging in their own data while benefiting from our encrypted FL and deployment framework. Open sourcing this work encourages peer review, transparency, and faster innovation. It aligns with our belief that no single entity should monopolize AI solutions for global health problems. Instead, by sharing knowledge and code, we can collectively raise the bar for what AI can do in cervical cancer prevention.","“...anyone can spin up their own instance - commercial or otherwise - or contribute to its improvement…”","The Ratio1 platform itself is designed to be developer-friendly (with SDKs and templates) and community-driven. We invite developers and domain experts to join us in improving the AI models and expanding the capabilities of this pipeline. For instance, one could integrate an HPV testing module, or extend the system to other screening tasks (like detecting other pathologies from medical images) - all within the same decentralized, privacy-preserving framework. By keeping the system modular and open, we lower the barrier for others to create production-grade applications on top of our work, whether for research or real deployments.","With our decentralized, encrypted learning pipeline, AI-powered cervical cancer screening can be delivered anywhere - from a cutting-edge hospital to the most remote village - without compromising privacy or requiring heavy infrastructure. Each clinic or practitioner retains ownership of their data and control of the AI, embodying the Ratio1 ethos: Your AI, your Data. Homomorphic encryption and federated learning (EDIL) ensure that even as the AI learns from thousands of patients, no sensitive information is exposed. A network of lightweight edge nodes means that a nurse can get instant AI guidance during a screening, even offline, by leveraging computing power next door or a few villages over. And the blockchain backbone instills confidence that every step, from model training to prediction, is transparent and verifiable in a trustless ecosystem.","“...we welcome collaboration from all corners - technologists, healthcare workers, researchers - to further refine and (much more importantly) “Deeploy” this solution…”","This approach isn’t just theoretical - it’s being built now. We have demonstrated classification of transformation zone types and detection of cervical lesions using our pipeline on distributed data from multiple sources, all while keeping the data encrypted and decentralized. The results are encouraging: the model’s performance is on par with training on centralized data, but with far greater privacy and scalability. More importantly, the real-world impact could be immense. By deploying AI in a decentralized way, a network of small clinics could collectively achieve diagnostic accuracy that rivals big urban hospitals, helping to close the healthcare gap. Each additional node (clinic) that joins the network not only benefits from the global model but also contributes to making it better - a virtuous cycle for continual improvement in cervical cancer prevention.","We believe this is a paradigm shift in how critical healthcare AI solutions can be delivered. Decentralization, privacy, and openness form the trifecta that can empower doctors and patients everywhere. A future where no woman is denied a life-saving screening due to her location or privacy concerns is within reach, if we harness technology in a thoughtful, human-centric way. At Ratio1.ai, we’re committed to making that future a reality, and we welcome collaboration from all corners - technologists, healthcare workers, researchers - to further refine and (much more importantly) “Deeploy” this solution.","Andrei Ionut Damian","Sep 11, 2025","‹ Deeploy Secrets Setup Guide","J33VES x Keysoft x Ratio1 - Three Assistants That Turn Intent into Results ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

Partner Keysoft used J33VES to create AI assistants that transform plain‑language descriptions into database schemas and user interfaces, generate SQL‑driven reports and enforce policy‑grounded chatbots, all while keeping data encrypted in R1FS and using decentralized identities through dAuth.","RedMesh v1, a decentralized, distributed penetration‑testing framework, was released following last month's inception. It performs continuous security testing across edge nodes and is open‑sourced to encourage community participation. CerviSafe - a proof‑of‑concept for privacy‑preserving cervical‑cancer screening - demonstrates how Ratio1 can enable secure healthcare workflows using federated learning and homomorphic encryption. LabelCraft v0.5 public beta and Petware cross‑native/generic AI templates entered testing, expanding the AI‑for‑Everyone toolkit.","September was indeed the international expansion focus month - Ratio1 held extensive meetings with international consortiums (including Horizon Europe, Pathfinder and EIC) to embed decentralized AI in large‑scale healthcare and cybersecurity projects. Partnerships span more than 15 countries and involve tens of companies across academia, research institutes and industry.","Last but not least community growth & education  - The AI‑for‑Everyone creation toolkit and LabelCraft saw major enhancements. Educational resources (e.g., TikTok tutorials and Ratio1 Courses) continue to be developed in order to draw new developers and non‑technical users into the ecosystem. NodeJS integration and template applications like Ratio1 Drive make it easier for developers in other ecosystems to build on Ratio1.","First enterprise deployment: Keysoft’s production‑grade application built with the J33VES framework went live. The app includes three AI assistants: a schema and UI generator that translates plain‑English descriptions into relational database schemas and interface code, a report builder that produces SQL‑based dashboards from those schemas, and a policy‑grounded chatbot for compliant support.","Privacy by design: Each assistant runs on open‑weight models and neuro‑symbolic tools hosted on the decentralized network. User data and knowledge stay encrypted in R1FS, with dAuth enabling decentralized identities. This production launch validates J33VES as a robust alternative to proprietary AI assistants and positions Ratio1 to power similar enterprise deployments.","Building on Deeploy v1 (which provided full web UI/UX for container orchestration), v2 automates the entire job lifecycle. CSP users can create, edit and extend jobs via the UI, schedule start times and adjust parameters mid‑execution. The new job‑editing feature (R1‑443) eliminates the need to redeploy a container when tweaking configuration.","Deeploy now generates draft invoices for each completed job and provides burn reports showing how many R1 tokens were permanently burned as part of the job’s escrow settlement. This transparency aligns with PoAI’s on‑chain escrow system and ensures that compute costs and token supply adjustments are visible to all stakeholders.","The escrow smart contracts have been upgraded to fully automate rewards distribution to node operators and developers. Users deposit stablecoins into escrow; funds are allocated automatically once proof‑of‑AI verifies that the compute work is complete and burn reports are published.","Crowdsourced data labeling: LabelCraft, part of the AI‑for‑Everyone (AI4E) initiative, gamifies data annotation and rewards volunteers with tokens. The v0.5 beta introduces improved tasks, enhanced quality‑control through multiple annotator consensus and a new leaderboard system. The app’s smart contract automatically distributes rewards once enough labels are collected and verified.","Integration with creation toolkit: LabelCraft seamlessly feeds annotations into the Creation Toolkit so that end‑users can build custom ML models on mobile devices via a guided wizard. The v0.5 beta also improves integration with decentralized training pipelines, enabling federated training over R1FS using homomorphic encryption.","Still in work Petware introduces a set of template applications that illustrate how Ratio1’s decentralized compute and storage can power both native and generic AI workflows. Templates include an end‑to‑end pipeline for building object‑recognition apps, a federated analytics dashboard and a low‑code starter kit for domain‑specific assistants based on computer vision. These templates, available soon, lower the barrier for developers to create cross‑platform AI apps and will be refined based on community feedback.","Initially introduced last month, RedMesh is a decentralized, open‑source framework for continuous penetration testing. Jobs are announced across the network via CStore and executed by multiple edge nodes, allowing simultaneous scanning and vulnerability analysis. Findings are aggregated without a centralized server and results are stored on‑chain to ensure trust and immutability.","Unlike centralized commercial pentest platforms, RedMesh offers decentralized distributed execution, built‑in blockchain trust, open‑source transparency, continuous scanning, and resilience to single‑node failures. The release includes plugins based on various standards such as OWASP for service fingerprinting, web vulnerability scanning and compliance auditing, and forms the foundation for Ratio1’s cybersecurity offerings.","CerviSafe, currently in proof‑of‑concept stage, is a framework for operationalizing decentralized cervical‑cancer screening. It uses a mobile‑first pipeline where clinics capture images locally; models are trained via federated learning with homomorphic encryption so that raw data stays on devices. Encrypted model updates are aggregated on the network and a global model is distributed back to clinics, providing accurate screening without exposing personal data.","The PoC responds to limited specialist availability and privacy concerns in underserved regions by enabling remote AI‑powered diagnosis. On‑chain traceability ensures that screening outcomes are transparent and verifiable while the EDIL framework (Encrypted Decentralized Inference and Learning) provides strong privacy guarantees.","Throughout September, Ratio1’s leadership participated in extensive meetings with international consortiums aiming to integrate decentralized AI into large‑scale projects. These consortiums include Pathfinder, European Innovation Council (EIC) and Horizon Europe initiatives focusing on healthcare, cybersecurity, energy and public‑sector innovation.","Prospective partnerships involve tens of companies across more than 15 countries, from academic institutions and research institutes to SMEs and multinational corporations. By collaborating with Ratio1, these partners plan to leverage decentralized compute (edge nodes), encrypted storage (R1FS), federated learning and token‑based incentives for fair collaboration.","Integrating Ratio1 into these consortiums can accelerate development of privacy‑preserving health diagnostics (e.g., expanded CerviSafe), continuous cybersecurity monitoring (leveraging RedMesh) and energy‑efficient AI services. Participation also positions Ratio1 as a key player in shaping EU‑level standards for trustless AI and fosters adoption across industries.","September’s achievements lay the groundwork for an explosive final quarter. With an enterprise application live, core services upgraded and new proofs‑of‑concept demonstrating both cybersecurity and healthcare use‑cases, Ratio1 is transitioning from testing to real‑world adoption. In the coming months the team plans to:","Formalize agreements with Pathfinder, EIC and Horizon Europe consortia. Pilot joint projects in healthcare and cybersecurity to showcase Ratio1’s decentralization benefits.","Extend J33VES assistants to more customers and refine Keysoft’s production system. Explore integration with other enterprise platforms through standardized APIs.","Incorporate community feedback and launch Petware 1.0, enabling anyone to create cross‑platform AI apps with minimal code.","Continue improving the NodeJS clients and templates, release SDKs for other languages and provide more templates and tutorials.","Release new courses, intensify outreach on social media and host hackathons to onboard developers, researchers and non‑technical users.","By continuously delivering on roadmap goals and forging strategic partnerships, Ratio1 is positioning itself as the decentralized AI operating system for the next decade.","Petrica Butusina","Oct 3, 2025","‹ Deploy Your App with Ratio1’s Worker App Runner - No CI/CD Required","Deeploy Secrets Setup Guide ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

We’re excited to unveil the Worker App Runner [R1-334] - a new plugin (and Deeploy job type) that lets you run applications directly from source code, without requiring a pre-built container image. This technical yet business-oriented overview will explain what the Worker App Runner is, why we built it, and how it empowers our “Your AI, your Data” paradigm.","Traditionally, deploying on Ratio1 required a container image for your app. Our existing Container App Runner plugin assumes you’ve already built and pushed a Docker/Podman image of your application (specified via an IMAGE tag like \"my_repo/my_app:latest\" in the config). While effective, that approach meant extra work: you had to containerize your code and manage image registries before running anything - a classic and sound CNCF practice that sometimes can be seen as an overkill as for many developers and data scientists, this container prep can be a hurdle.","What if you just want to quickly run your code on the edge to test a new model or microservice? Spinning up a full CI/CD pipeline or maintaining a container registry for every tweak is cumbersome. We realized we needed a more agile way to go “from Git repo to running application” in one step.","That’s why we developed the Worker App Runner. It eliminates the friction by letting Ratio1 handle the containerization on the fly. You provide your code (Git repo link) and how to build/run it, and the platform takes care of the rest. This innovation aligns with our decentralized philosophy: you maintain control of your code and deployment process, with less reliance on external infrastructure.","The Worker App Runner is a new plugin available in the Ratio1 Deeploy system as a job type. (Recall that Deeploy is Ratio1’s decentralized managed orchestration layer - think Kubernetes, but powered by blockchain and a peer-to-peer node network - more information at https://ratio1.ai/blog/decentralized-cloud-computing-and-beyond  and the more recent blog at https://ratio1.ai/blog/deeploy-unlocked-accessing-the-power-of-ratio1.","In simpler terms, the Worker App Runner is a job you can launch on the Ratio1 network which will fetch your application’s code, build it and run it inside a container on an edge node, without you having to pre-build that container image.","Just like our standard container runner (ie. the Ratio1 CONTAINER_APP_RUNNER), the Worker App Runner still uses container technology under the hood for consistency and isolation. It inherits all the capabilities of the Container App Runner - for example, it can allocate a host port and expose your app via a secure Cloudflare tunnel if you’re running a web service. It also supports environment variables, resource limits (CPU, GPU, memory), automatic log capture, and other features you’re used to in Ratio1’s runtime plugins.","The key difference: With Worker App Runner you don’t supply a finished image, you supply a code repository and build instructions. The plugin will start a base container image (by default a lightweight Node.js LTS on Alpine Linux, though you can specify any base image), then clone your Git repository into that container and execute a series of build and run commands that you provide. In essence, it automates what a Dockerfile or devops script might do, but at runtime on the target node.","When you launch a Worker App Runner job, here’s what happens step by step (all automatically orchestrated by the plugin):","1. Base Container Launch: The system pulls and starts the specified base image (for example, node:lts-alpine by default, or you might use python:3.10-slim for a Python app). The container is started in a paused state (often via a dummy command like a sleep loop) to keep it running while we set up your app inside.","2. Code Retrieval: Next, the Worker App Runner clones your Git repository into the container’s filesystem. Under the hood, it runs a command equivalent to:","This brings in all your application code. (Private repos can be accessed using a token in the URL, which the plugin supports.)","3. Build Commands Execution: After cloning, the plugin executes the list of build and run commands you provided in the config. This could be anything needed to install dependencies and launch the app. For example, you might specify [\"npm install\", \"npm start\"] for a Node.js project, or [\"pip install -r requirements.txt\", \"python main.py\"] for a Python project. These commands are run inside the container one by one. Essentially, the Worker App Runner composes a shell command chaining your steps with && (and has logging to show each command running). In this way, it replicates the steps of building the app environment just as you would on a fresh machine or in a Dockerfile, but does it live on the node.","4. Application Starts Serving: Once the build commands finish, your application is up and running inside the container. If you configured a network port for the app, the plugin will have mapped it and (optionally) established a cloudflare tunnel automatically so the service is reachable externally. Logs from the app are streamed and captured by the plugin in real-time, so you can monitor output from the Ratio1 dashboard or CLI just as with any other job.","5. Monitoring and Lifecycle: The Worker App Runner keeps the container running and can restart it if needed (for example, if you issue a restart command, or if in the future we add auto-redeploy on new git commits). When you stop the job, the plugin will gracefully shut down the container and save logs to disk, ensuring you have a record of what happened.","All these steps happen seamlessly once you kick off the job. In practical use, it means you can deploy code to the edge in one click - you point to your repo and the platform handles container setup, building, and launching your app.","One of the most powerful aspects of Ratio1’s platform is our commitment to decentralization and user control. The Worker App Runner is built with that same ethos in mind. By allowing you to deploy straight from your own code repository, we’re enabling a workflow where you remain in full control of your AI application and data. There’s no need to upload your code to a third-party service to build an image, nor to rely on a centralized CI/CD pipeline. Everything runs on the distributed Ratio1 network under your direction.","This aligns with our mantra: “Your app, your data” (or as we often say in AI context, “Your AI, your Data”). In other words, you decide where your application runs and where your data stays. Ratio1’s decentralized infrastructure (often described as a “MetaOS” or operating system for decentralized AI) ensures that your workloads can run on permissioned or dedicated nodes if needed, providing compliance and privacy, while still benefiting from cloud-like scalability. The Worker App Runner extends this paradigm by making deployment easier without sacrificing that sovereignty. Your code stays yours - you’re simply instructing the Ratio1 network to run it as a job, with no central cloud provider in the middle extracting your code or data.","Moreover, because Deeploy is blockchain-governed and peer-to-peer, there’s transparency and trust in how your job is executed. The addition of this new job type doesn’t change the security model: your app runs in a container sandbox on the chosen nodes, and if it’s a service, it’s exposed via secure tunnels rather than public IPs. This means you get both ease of deployment and peace of mind that the underlying platform remains decentralized and secure by design.","You might be wondering when to use the traditional Container App Runner versus the new Worker App Runner. Both have their place, and here’s a quick comparison:","Deployment Input: The Container App Runner expects an existing container image name (IMAGE), which you or someone must have built beforehand[2]. In contrast, the Worker App Runner expects a Git repo URL and build commands, and it handles creating the containerized environment at runtime[5]. No pre-built image is needed - just your source code.","Use Case: Container App Runner is ideal if you already have a Docker image (perhaps built by your CI pipeline or downloaded from a registry) and you want a fast startup. It’s basically “bring your own container.” Worker App Runner is ideal for development and continuous deployment scenarios - when you have an app in source form and want to deploy quickly or frequently update it without managing images. It’s “bring your own code.”","Speed: Because Container App Runner skips the build step (it just pulls & runs the image), it might launch slightly faster, especially for large applications where building from source is time-consuming. Worker App Runner has an initial build phase on first run; however, subsequent runs can reuse cached layers (since Docker will cache the base image and any OS-level packages). If your build commands are efficient (or your repo is small), the overhead is minimal for the convenience gained.","Flexibility: Worker App Runner offers more flexibility for tweaking and iterating. Want to test a quick code change? Just push to your repo and (in a future update) the Worker runner could detect the new commit and redeploy your app automatically. Even without automatic triggers, it’s very easy to redeploy with new code; no need to rebuild a container image manually. On the other hand, Container runner might be preferred for very stable components that rarely change or for third-party images you trust (databases, etc.).","Volume & File Access: Both plugins allow mounting volumes if needed, but the Worker App Runner by design works with ephemeral code inside the container. If your app needs to save state or results, you can map a host directory into the container (just as with Container App Runner) for persistence. Both support environment variables and resource configs similarly, since Worker inherits those settings from the base plugin.","In summary, Container App Runner = bring a container; Worker App Runner = bring your code. They complement each other. We expect many users will use Worker App Runner for their own custom apps and AI models, while still using Container App Runner for standard services or when sharing pre-built images.","From a workflow perspective, the Worker App Runner can significantly streamline your deployment pipeline. Consider a common scenario: you’ve developed a new version of your AI microservice on your laptop. Previously, deploying it to Ratio1 would involve writing a Dockerfile, building an image, pushing it to a container registry (with proper tags), and then updating your Deeploy job to use that new image. With Worker App Runner, you skip several of those steps:","No manual image build: Just push your code to a Git repository (or even work off a branch), and point the Worker App Runner to that repo. The “build” happens automatically on the target node. This reduces the need for Docker expertise or build servers on your end.","Faster iteration: Because deployment is as easy as pointing to new code, you can iterate faster. Early testing, QA, or demo deployments can be done by anyone on the team with minimal devops overhead. This lowers the barrier for experimentation on real distributed hardware.","Consistent environments: The base images (like official Node, Python, etc.) provide a known starting environment, and your specified commands ensure the environment is set up exactly as your app needs. In a way, Worker App Runner acts like an automated container factory each time you deploy. This consistency can be easier to manage than, say, running code directly on VMs or bare metal - you still get the benefits of container isolation and reproducibility, without having to hand-craft the container each time.","Reduced external dependencies: Because the build and run happen within the Ratio1 network’s nodes, you might not need external CI/CD services for building images. Of course, you can still use them if you prefer, but it’s now optional. Ratio1 is providing a form of integrated build automation as part of the deployment process. This can simplify your tech stack and potentially cut costs or complexity.","Commercially, this means faster time-to-market and lower ops overhead for projects running on Ratio1. Teams can focus on writing code and training models, knowing that deploying those to production (or edge locations) is not a bottleneck. In edge AI scenarios - where you might need to update models or logic frequently across many distributed nodes - the ability to automatically rebuild and roll out from source is a game-changer. It brings cloud-like continuous delivery to a decentralized infrastructure.","The Worker App Runner exemplifies the kind of balanced innovation we strive for at Ratio1. On the technical side, it provides a powerful new tool for developers to deploy AI and software workloads in a decentralized manner, automating containerization and leveraging our robust on-chain orchestration. On the commercial side, it adds tangible value for organizations by simplifying devops workflows and speeding up delivery. This feature can reduce the time and skill needed to deploy complex applications across distributed infrastructure - translating to lower costs and quicker iterations for businesses.","By bridging the gap between raw container tech and developer-friendly automation, we’re making the Ratio1 platform more accessible and flexible. Businesses adopting Ratio1 can now onboard projects faster, even if their teams have limited container expertise. And they do so without giving up the advantages of decentralization. In fact, the decentralized nature of Ratio1 is a selling point here: you get cloud convenience without central cloud lock-in. As highlighted in a recent case study, Ratio1’s approach gives users fine-grained control and transparency, aligning infrastructure with a decentralization ethos. The Worker App Runner continues that mission - you control your AI and your data, and now you have an easier path to run that AI wherever your data is.","The introduction of the Worker App Runner plugin marks an exciting step for the Ratio1 ecosystem. It’s not just a new feature - it’s a statement that deploying AI applications can be both easier and more autonomous. By allowing code-first deployments on our decentralized network, we empower users to move quickly while retaining control. Whether you’re an indie developer iterating on an AI model, or an enterprise rolling out edge services across many locations, this new job type will streamline your workflow and enhance your ownership of the process.","We invite our community to try out the Worker App Runner and share feedback. It will be available in the Deeploy dashboard as a selectable job type in the upcoming release. We believe it will become a cornerstone for many deployments, combining the best of cloud agility with the unique strengths of Ratio1’s decentralized platform. With features like these, we continue to drive toward a future where AI is powered by you - your code, on your data, running where you decide, with Ratio1 handling the heavy lifting in the background.","Stay tuned for more updates as we integrate automatic redeploys on code changes and other enhancements to the Worker App Runner. In the meantime, say goodbye to the friction of manual container builds and hello to a new era of frictionless edge deployment on Ratio1. Your AI, your data, your deployment - now just one git push away from reality.","Vitalii Toderian","Sep 5, 2025","‹ J33VES x Keysoft x Ratio1 - Three Assistants That Turn Intent into Results","Monthly Report - August 2025 ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

Today we are shipping two tightly coupled projects that make building on Ratio1 feel native in Go: edge_sdk_go, our idiomatic Go SDK for the CStore and R1FS services on every Ratio1 edge node, and r1-plugins-sandbox, a plug-and-play local twin of those services for development. Together they give your team a frictionless path from prototype to production on the Ratio1 stack - no custom shims, no guesswork, and no live infrastructure required while you iterate.","Built side by side, the SDK and sandbox mirror the same primitives that power Ratio1 edge nodes in the field. CStore behaves like a Redis-inspired key/value store with optimistic concurrency, while R1FS brings IPFS-style content addressing and artifact management into your workflow. With the Go SDK you can talk to both with just a few lines of code. With the sandbox, you can exercise every edge-node API from any language, right on your laptop, with predictable fixtures and even optional chaos-testing knobs at your disposal.","The SDK lives in the edge_sdk_go GitHub repository and it ships with batteries included:","Easy bootstrapping: Use cstore.NewFromEnv() and r1fs.NewFromEnv() to initialize ready-to-use clients from the standard EE_CHAINSTORE_API_URL and EE_R1FS_API_URL environment variables (the endpoints for CStore and R1FS). No manual config needed.","Familiar data operations: The clients expose intuitive methods. For example, CStore offers Set, Get, HSet, HGetAll, etc., and R1FS provides methods like AddFile, AddFileBase64, AddYAML, GetFile, GetYAML, CalculateJSONCID, and more – all following patterns you’d expect.","Context-aware requests: Every request method accepts a context.Context, making cancellation and deadlines first-class citizens for your pipelines and background workers.","Below is a quick taste of using the SDK in Go (error handling abbreviated for brevity):","The SDK’s examples/ directory doubles as a living integration test suite and tutorial. Run go run ./examples/cstore to walk through optimistic writes, hash operations, and status checks. Likewise, go run ./examples/r1fs uploads some content to R1FS and then retrieves it, illustrating how content-addressed storage works in practice. This blend of code and documentation is intentional – we want the path from “hello world” to a production-ready service to be as short as possible for Go developers.","Shipping a polished SDK is only half the story. Real developer velocity also requires an environment you can spin up instantly, share with teammates, and wire into automated tests. That’s where r1-plugins-sandbox comes in.","The sandbox is a small Go binary that mirrors the CStore and R1FS REST APIs (the same FastAPI plugins that run on live Ratio1 edge nodes). Launch it with a single command and it prints out the environment exports your clients expect:","Set those environment variables in your shell, and now any Ratio1 SDK client (Go or otherwise) will automatically talk to your local sandbox instead of a live node. From there, you can point any language or tool at localhost and exercise the complete API surface: optimistic key/value operations, hash map fields, binary file uploads, content-addressed retrievals, CID calculations - you name it.","Because the sandbox exposes the same HTTP endpoints as a real node, it’s completely language-agnostic. You can use the official Go SDK, the Ratio1 NodeJS/TypeScript SDK (edge-sdk-ts), a Python script, or even just curl – the behavior will be identical. This makes the sandbox an ideal bridge for teams experimenting with Ratio1 primitives from different stacks, all while keeping tests hermetic and reproducible.","The sandbox is also configurable to simulate real-world conditions. Need consistent test data? Seed deterministic key/value entries with the --kv-seed flag and preload files with --fs-seed. Want to test your code’s resilience to slow networks or flaky nodes? Add artificial latency with --latency 200ms or inject failures using --fail rate=0.1,code=503 (meaning ~10% of requests will return an HTTP 503 error). These options let you dial up the chaos to ensure your retry and timeout logic is rock-solid before you ever hit production.","Getting started with Ratio1’s Go tools is straightforward:","Install the SDK: Add the Go module to your project with go get github.com/Ratio1/edge_sdk_go. Import the pkg/cstore and pkg/r1fs packages in your code to access the clients.","Download the Sandbox: Head over to the r1-plugins-sandbox releases page and grab the binary for your platform (Linux, macOS, Windows are all available). Unpack it and put r1-plugins-sandbox in your $PATH.","Run the Sandbox: Start the sandbox locally (./r1-plugins-sandbox) and export the EE_CHAINSTORE_API_URL and EE_R1FS_API_URL variables it prints out. This ensures the SDK knows how to find your local sandbox services.","Use the Examples or Your Code: Try the provided example programs (go run ./examples/...) to verify everything is working end-to-end. Then integrate the Ratio1 SDK into your own Go service by using cstore.NewFromEnv() and r1fs.NewFromEnv() - when you’re ready to go live, just change the environment variables to point to a real Ratio1 edge node and your code won’t need any other changes.","(Integration from other languages is easy too: you can hit the sandbox’s HTTP APIs directly or use our official TypeScript SDK for NodeJS. Everything the sandbox does locally mirrors the behavior of live edge nodes, so you can prototype in any environment.)","In deployment scenarios, you can even keep the sandbox wired into your CI pipeline to run end-to-end tests on every commit. Once you’re satisfied, deploy your code to actual Ratio1 edge nodes; the Go SDK will automatically use the environment variables provided by the node, and your app will seamlessly transition from local sandbox to live infrastructure. This zero-diff swap between sandbox and production is intentional: the routes, payloads, and responses are identical.","This release is a major step toward making Ratio1 development feel native across languages, frameworks, and team sizes. Grab the Go SDK, spin up the sandbox, and show us what you build! Whether you’re running offline batch jobs, chaining AI model inference, or developing a partner integration, we can’t wait to see how you bring Ratio1’s primitives to life in Go  -  and beyond.","As always, we invite you to join the Ratio1 developer community (Discord and other channels) and share your feedback. Let us know how you’re using the new tools and which features you’d like to see prioritized next. Your workflows and ideas will help shape where the platform goes from here.

If it expires, you will need to create a new token and update it in Deeploy.","Once created, copy the token and paste it into the API Key field in Deeploy.","With the default setup, Deeploy creates a tunnel subdomain like: abcdef123456.yourdomain.com. Your application will be available at this address once deployed.","You can also point a custom subdomain such as app.otherdomain.com to the tunnel using a CNAME record, as long as both domains are under the same Cloudflare account.","If you want to point external domains (domains not managed in Cloudflare, or domains belonging to a client with a separate Cloudflare account) to your tunnels, you need to activate Cloudflare for SaaS.

Ratio1’s new Worker App Runner lets you launch apps straight from your GitHub repository - no CI/CD pipelines, no Docker builds, and no server setup needed[1][2]. This tutorial will walk you through two easy ways to use the Worker App Runner to deploy an application from source code to the edge in minutes, using only your Git repo URL. We’ll cover:","Method 1: SDK Deployment - using the Ratio1 Python SDK in a few lines of code. (Requires developer access and node whitelist.)","Method 2: Deeploy UI Deployment - a no-code, step-by-step process using the Ratio1 Deeploy web app with screenshots. (Requires CSP access with an Oracle node.)","Along the way, we’ll highlight prerequisites, explain each step in plain English, and show how Ratio1’s platform handles the heavy lifting (building, containerization, and even auto-redeploy on new commits) behind the scenes. By the end, you’ll see how to get your app running on Ratio1’s decentralized network with zero infrastructure hassle - just push your code and go!","Before we dive in, make sure you have the following in place:","A Ratio1 Edge Node (Mainnet, Devnet or Testnet) available to run your app.","Ratio1 SDK installed (for Method 1). You can install it with pip (pip install ratio1_sdk --upgrade). Ensure your SDK client is whitelisted on the node you’ll use - i.e. the node must allow your SDK’s address to submit jobs. (On a self-hosted node, run r1ctl config show to get your SDK client address, then add it to the node’s allowed list using the add_allowed <address> command[4].)","Deeploy App access (for Method 2). You’ll need to log into the Deeploy web app with your CSP account. Make sure you have a crypto wallet (MetaMask, for example) connected with sufficient USDC for deployment costs, since Deeploy will escrow funds for the job.","A GitHub repository containing the application you want to deploy. This can be a public repo or a private one (if private, have a Personal Access Token ready for clone access). The repo should include any build scripts or configuration needed to run the app. In our example, we’ll deploy a simple web application (a React app) from a GitHub repo.","(Optional) Cloudflare Tunnel credentials if your app is a web service you’d like to expose externally. The Worker App Runner can automatically set up a Cloudflare tunnel to give your app a public URL. We’ll show where to input a Cloudflare Tunnel token - it’s not required, but without it the app will only be reachable within the node’s network.","Note: This tutorial uses Ratio1 Devnet for demonstration (all screenshots are from Devnet). The process is similar on other networks, but Devnet is ideal for testing. Now, let’s get started!","If you prefer coding or want to automate deployments, the Ratio1 Python SDK provides a simple interface to launch a Worker App Runner job. This method is great for developers iterating on apps, as it allows integration with your development workflow. We’ll use a short Python script to deploy our app directly from a GitHub repo.","How it works: The SDK will instruct a Ratio1 node to launch a Worker App Runner job with your repo info and commands. The node will automatically: clone your repository, run your build steps, start the app inside a container, and monitor the repo for any new commits (re-deploying the app when changes are detected). All of this happens on the edge node without you manually building or pushing any container image - truly “git push to deploy”![5][6]","Below is an example deployment script (https://github.com/Ratio1/ratio1_sdk/blob/main/tutorials/ex23_deploy_worker_app.py) from the Ratio1 SDK tutorials which demonstrates launching a Worker App Runner job. This script requires that your SDK is connected to a Ratio1 node and that the node has whitelisted your client address. Update the placeholders (GitHub repo info, etc.) to your own project, then run the script to deploy:","Let’s break down what this code is doing:","Connect to the Ratio1 network: The script creates a Session object, which establishes a connection to the Ratio1 node (using your local SDK configuration). We use silent=False so we can see some logs. Be sure the my_node variable is set to the address of the node you want to deploy on (here it’s a placeholder \"0xai_...\" string). Remember, this node must trust our SDK client (hence the whitelist requirement mentioned earlier).","Cloudflare Tunnel (optional): The script prompts for a Cloudflare tunnel token. If you provide one, the Worker App Runner will use it to expose your app on a public URL via Cloudflare. If you hit Enter without a token, the app will still run, but without an external URL (you’d only be able to access it if connected to the node’s network).","Specify the Git repository (VCS data): In the vcs_data dictionary, we fill in details of our GitHub repo. In this example, it’s set to a repository (my-super-react-app) under a certain user. You should replace \"USERNAME\", \"REPO_OWNER\", \"REPO_NAME\", and possibly the \"BRANCH\" with your repo’s info. If your repo is private, you’d also supply a \"TOKEN\" (a GitHub PAT) so the node can clone it. Currently, GitHub is the supported provider[7].","Set resource requirements: We define container_resources like CPU (1 core), memory (512MB), and no GPU for this app. These ensure the node allocates sufficient resources. We could also specify ports here (e.g., open port 3000) if our app needed it - our example leaves the ports commented out for now, except we will expose port 4173 later when creating the app.","Define build and run commands: In build_and_run_commands, we list the shell commands the Worker App Runner should execute inside the container to build and start our app. Here it’s a Node.js project, so we do npm install, then npm run build, then npm run serve. (This assumes the repo has appropriate npm scripts; you could put any commands needed for your app, like installing Python dependencies and running a Python script, etc.)[8]. These commands will be run sequentially inside the container.","(Optional) Set environment variables or volumes: We prepare an env dict with any environment variables our app needs (here we set NODE_ENV: \"production\" as an example). We can also define volume mounts if needed (the example shows how to mount a host directory or define file volumes, but they’re empty by default)[9]. For simplicity, our app doesn’t require additional volumes or files.","Create and deploy the Worker Web App: The core of the script is the call to session.create_worker_web_app(...)[10][11]. Here we pass all the parameters:","node - the target node address.","name - a name for this app/job (simply for identification).","tunnel_engine=\"cloudflare\" and the cloudflare_token we got (to enable a web tunnel).","The vcs_data (repo info), image=\"node:22\" (base Docker image to use - Node.js 18/20 LTS in this case), and our build_and_run_commands.","cr_data (container registry credentials) we leave as default (using Docker Hub public, no credentials needed here).","env and resource limits, plus port=4173 (the internal port our app listens on; 4173 is used by the Vite dev server in this example app).","vcs_poll_interval=60 - this tells the runner to check the Git repo every 60 seconds for new commits[12]. If it sees a new commit on the specified branch, it will automatically pull the changes and restart the app! 🎉 This is how continuous deployment is achieved with zero CI/CD config.","The create_worker_web_app call returns an app object, which we then immediately deploy with app.deploy(). This triggers the job on the node.8. Confirmation and monitoring: If deployment succeeds, the script prints out some messages confirming that the worker webapp was deployed and summarizing its behavior (clone, monitor, expose via tunnel). The session.wait(...) at the end simply keeps the script alive for 5 minutes so you can observe the app running (and then it will close the session and stop the job). In a real scenario, you might not shut down the session like this - we do it here because it’s a tutorial script. The main point is that once app.deploy() is called, the job is running on the node and will keep running until stopped, even if your SDK session disconnects (unless you intentionally set it to close).","After running this script (and providing your Cloudflare token if you chose to), check your Ratio1 node’s dashboard or logs. You should see that a new WORKER_APP_RUNNER job started, pulled your code, and launched the app. If you provided a tunnel token, you’ll also get a public URL (often logged to console or obtainable via app.url if the SDK returns it). You can open that URL in a browser to view your running application. 🎉","Tip: The Worker App Runner job will continue to poll your GitHub repo. Try making a change (commit & push) on the specified branch - within ~60 seconds, the app will auto-rebuild and apply the update. No manual deploy steps needed! This built-in re-deploy feature makes development and continuous delivery a breeze, as the platform acts like your CI/CD pipeline[13]. If needed, you can adjust the vcs_poll_interval (e.g., for faster or slower checks) or even trigger manual redeploys via the SDK if you disable auto-polling.","Next, let’s look at how a CSP can deploy the same application through the Deeploy web UI. This method requires no coding - instead, you’ll use Ratio1’s dashboard to configure and launch the Worker App Runner job. It’s ideal for those who prefer a visual interface or are deploying for clients via the CSP portal. We’ll go through the entire flow with screenshots from the Devnet environment, from creating a project to seeing the app live.","Assumptions: You are logged into the Deeploy App with your CSP account (Devnet in our case), and you have at least one Oracle node available to run the job. Also, your wallet (MetaMask) is connected for signing transactions and has enough USDC to cover the deployment cost. The UI will guide us through creating a project, configuring a Worker App job with our GitHub repo, and funding the deployment.","Let’s get started with the UI steps:","Figure 01 (Devnet): Creating a new project in the Deeploy UI. In the Deeploy dashboard, start by clicking “Create Project”. Projects are like folders for your deployments - each project can contain one or more jobs (applications or services you want to run). Give your project a descriptive name (for example, the name of the app or the client), as this will help you organize deployments later. After filling in the project details, confirm to create the project.","Figure 02 (Devnet): Adding a Generic App job to the project. Once the project is created, you’ll be taken to the project page. Here, click on “Add Job” (or a similar “+ Add” button) and choose the Generic App template. The Generic App job type is a flexible template for running arbitrary applications. It allows you to deploy either by providing a pre-built container image or by using the Worker App Runner for source code. In our case, we’ll use the Worker App Runner path (deploy from Git), which is what makes it a “generic” app not tied to a pre-made image.","Figure 03 (Devnet): Specifying resources and app type for the new job. After selecting Generic App, you’ll need to enter the resource requirements and type of application. In this screen, configure how much CPU, memory, and how many nodes you want for your app. For example, you might choose 1 CPU, 0 GPUs, 512 MB RAM, on 1 node (since our app is lightweight). Also, ensure the App Type or mode is set to use the Worker App Runner (there may be a toggle or selection for “Deploy from Source (Worker)” vs “Deploy from Image”). This tells the platform that you will provide source code instead of a container image. Setting the correct resources is important to ensure your app has enough power to run; the UI will show an estimate of cost based on these specs.","Figure 04 (Devnet): Setting the job duration and reviewing cost estimates. Next, specify how long you want the job to run (the duration or timeout). For example, you might set it to run for a few epochs, or choose an option for an ongoing service with a certain billing cycle. In Devnet, we might set a short duration just for testing. The Deeploy UI will calculate the cost for the chosen duration and resource combination - here you can review the estimated USDC cost for running your app on the selected node(s) for that time. This step is crucial for budgeting: it ensures you’re aware of how much you’ll lock up in the escrow contract for the deployment. If everything looks good, proceed to the next step.","Figure 05 (Devnet): Adding a deployment alias and selecting target nodes. Now we provide a Deployment Alias and choose the target node(s). The alias is basically a nickname for this deployment (it could be the same as your project or app name, or something like “myapp-devnet-run”). This alias might be used for identifying the running job in dashboards or logs. Then, select which nodes will run the job. You can often filter nodes by attributes (Devnet might list available test nodes). In our example, we pick a specific Devnet node to host the app. (On mainnet or larger deployments, you could select multiple nodes or specific regions/tags as needed. For now, one node is fine.) Selecting the node ensures your job runs where you intend - e.g., your own node or a particular provider’s node that you trust or that meets certain compliance (KYB) labels.","Figure 06 (Devnet): Filling in the Worker App Runner details (Git repo and commands). This is the heart of the configuration - telling the Worker App Runner what to run. Here, you’ll input: - Repository URL or Info: Provide the GitHub URL of your repository (or specify owner/repo/branch in separate fields, depending on the UI). For example, enter the link to your my-super-react-app repository on GitHub and the branch name (e.g., main). If the UI has separate fields, fill in owner, repo name, and branch accordingly.- Build & Run Commands: List the commands the platform should execute to install dependencies and start the app. In a web form, this might be a multi-line text box or separate fields for each step. Following our example, we’d enter commands like npm install on one line, npm run build on the next, and npm run serve after that. These will be executed inside the container on the node.- Base Image: Choose a base container image for the job’s runtime. The default might be a Node.js image (since our repo looks like a Node project). If the UI has this field, select something like node:lts-alpine or a specific version (the equivalent of \"node:22\" we used in the SDK). This base image provides the runtime environment needed for your app (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.). You can typically leave it as default if it matches your app’s language.","Double-check these details, because this tells Ratio1 how to fetch and run your code. Essentially, you’re encoding what you’d normally do on a fresh machine to get your app running. Once done, continue to the next step.","Figure 07 (Devnet): Adding environment variables, policies, and finalizing the job. In this step, you can specify any environment variables your application needs (just like we did with the SDK’s env dict). For example, you might set NODE_ENV=production or any API keys or config variables required by your app. The UI likely provides a form to add key-value pairs for env vars. Also, there may be policy settings or advanced options - for instance, you might see fields for network policies, data access policies, or other security settings. In a basic deployment, you might not need to change these, but the option is there if your scenario requires it (e.g., restricting internet access, mounting volumes, etc.). After filling these in, review all the job details you’ve entered. You’re essentially finalizing the job configuration here. Once satisfied, click the button to Finalize or Create the job (exact wording may vary). This will prepare a deployment draft for you to review before actual launch.","Figure 08 (Devnet): Project draft summary and cost breakdown. Before deploying, the Deeploy App shows a summary of the project and job you’ve configured. This includes the resource allocation, duration, selected node(s), and the cost in USDC. Figure 08 shows an example summary screen. Review this carefully to make sure everything is correct. This is your last chance to catch any mistakes (like a typo in the repo URL or commands). The summary also clearly shows how much USDC will be needed. If all looks good, you’re ready to deploy and pay for the job.","Figure 09 (Devnet): Confirming the total cost and approving USDC spend in MetaMask. Upon confirming the deployment draft, the UI will prompt you to approve the payment. Since Ratio1 uses an on-chain escrow for job payments, you need to approve the spending of USDC from your wallet to the Ratio1 escrow contract. In Figure 09, we see the “Pay & Deploy” interface reminding us of the total cost. When you click the button to proceed, your MetaMask (or connected wallet) will pop up asking for an ERC-20 approval transaction. This approval allows the smart contract to pull the specified amount of USDC from your wallet. Go ahead and approve the transaction - you might be asked to set a spending cap (usually the exact amount or a bit more). Make sure the details (token and amount) are correct, then submit the approval.","Figure 10 (Devnet): MetaMask requesting to set a spending cap for USDC. In this MetaMask dialog (Figure 10), you can see it’s asking to allow access to USDC for the Ratio1 escrow contract, up to a certain amount. This is the standard token approval step. Confirm this to let the deployment proceed. Once you approve, wait for the blockchain transaction to confirm (the UI may indicate progress).","Figure 11 (Devnet): “Pay & Deploy” button becomes available after approval. After the USDC approval is confirmed on-chain, the Deeploy UI will enable a “Pay & Deploy” (or “Deploy Now”) button. Figure 11 shows the state where you can now click the final deploy button. This step will actually transfer the required USDC into the escrow and kick off the deployment on the network. Click Pay & Deploy to launch the job. The app will likely ask for one more confirmation to ensure you’re ready to deploy.","Figure 12 (Devnet): Final confirmation dialog for deploying the job. The UI might show a confirmation prompt (Figure 12) summarizing the job and asking “Are you sure you want to deploy?”. This is just a safeguard. Assuming you’re sure, confirm the deployment. Your wallet will then prompt you to sign or send the deployment transaction.","Figure 13 (Devnet): MetaMask signature request for the deployment transaction. In Figure 13, MetaMask is asking you to sign the deployment transaction. This likely involves a message signature or a direct contract call that locks your funds and signals the Ratio1 network to start the job. No additional funds are taken here (you already approved the amount); this is just the execution step. Go ahead and sign the transaction. The Deeploy app will then show a loading state as it waits for the job to be created on-chain and picked up by the target node.","Figure 14 (Devnet): Confirmation of the message signing and job launch. After signing, you might see a “Deploying...” loader or a message like in Figure 14 indicating that the deployment is being processed. This step may take a few moments as the on-chain transaction is mined and the Oracle node initiates the job. Once done, you should receive a success notification.","Figure 15 (Devnet): Successful deployment message in the Deeploy App. Success! The UI now shows that your job has been deployed. Figure 15 displays a message confirming the deployment (often something like “Deployment successful” or showing a job ID). At this point, your application is being launched on the selected edge node.","Figure 16 (Devnet): The project now shows the job in a Running state. Returning to the project dashboard, you’ll see your job listed, likely with a status indicator. In Figure 16, the project view shows the job as Running (meaning the node has successfully started the container and your app is up). You might see details like start time, the node name, and a timer for how long it will run (based on the duration you set). From here, you can click on the job to see more information or manage it.","Figure 17 (Devnet): Job detail page with configuration and controls. Clicking into the job, you get a detailed view (Figure 17) of the deployment’s configuration and status. This page typically shows all the settings you provided (environment vars, repo info, etc.), logs output from your app (so you can check if the build succeeded and the app started properly), and possibly controls to stop or extend the job. It’s a good place to verify that the Worker App Runner did indeed clone your repo and run the commands. For example, you might see log lines for npm install and npm run serve. If you provided a Cloudflare tunnel, there may also be a link to your app’s URL here.","Figure 18 (Devnet): The web app is live and accessible (loaded in a browser). Now for the fun part - accessing your running application! Since we enabled a Cloudflare tunnel (via our token), the system created a public URL for our app. You can find this URL in the job details (often labeled as “Webapp URL” or similar). Open that URL in your browser, and you should see your app running live, as shown in Figure 18. In our example, it’s a React app, and the screenshot confirms the app’s UI loading correctly from the edge node. This means our code was successfully built and launched on the node, and the tunnel is working. 🎉 Take a moment to appreciate that we deployed this without writing any Dockerfiles or setting up any servers - it was all handled by Ratio1!","Figure 19 (Devnet): The app’s UI after pushing a new commit - changes deployed automatically. What about updates to the code? One of the coolest features of Worker App Runner is that it continuously monitors the repo. To demonstrate, we made a small change in the GitHub repository (perhaps changing some text or styling in the app) and pushed a new commit. Figure 19 shows the application’s interface updated accordingly (for instance, you might notice a new message or element in the UI). We didn’t have to reconfigure or manually redeploy anything - the system detected the commit, pulled the changes, rebuilt the app, and seamlessly restarted it inside the container. Essentially, we got a continuous deployment behavior with zero extra effort. This is the “no CI/CD” promise in action: just push your code, and the running app reflects the latest version automatically.","Figure 20 (Devnet): GitHub commit history showing the new commit that triggered the update. For verification, Figure 20 highlights the GitHub commit that we pushed. You can see the commit message (e.g., “Update homepage text”) and timestamp. This corresponds to the change that the Worker App Runner picked up. Because we set the poll interval to 60 seconds, the update was applied within about a minute of this commit. If you check the Ratio1 job logs, you’d likely see it noticing a new commit hash, then re-running the build commands. This confirms end-to-end that our deployment is connected to our source code - true continuous delivery without any external CI/CD service.","At this point, we’ve successfully deployed our application using both methods: via the SDK script and via the Deeploy web UI. You can stop the application by ending the job (through the SDK or the Deeploy interface), or let it run until the duration expires (at which time the job will stop and funds will be released if any unused). Now, let’s compare the two approaches and address some common questions.","Both the SDK and the Deeploy UI ultimately achieve the same result - your app running on the Ratio1 network via the Worker App Runner - but they cater to different use cases and users. Here’s a quick comparison:","Setup & Access: The SDK method is code-driven and requires developer setup (installing the SDK, having Python environment, and node access via whitelist). It’s great for automating tasks or integrating into your development workflow. The Deeploy UI method is accessible through a web browser with your wallet; it’s more user-friendly for non-developers or CSPs managing deployments for clients. However, it requires CSP status and an Oracle node (which entails some upfront onboarding, as discussed). If you’re already a node operator or developer, SDK might feel straightforward; if you’re operating as a CSP or prefer GUIs, the Deeploy app is ideal.","Speed & Convenience: Using the SDK, you can script deployments and potentially integrate with your tooling (even trigger the script from your CI if you wanted). It’s very fast to redeploy by running a script, and you can version-control that script. The UI, on the other hand, guides you step-by-step and might be slightly slower for repeated deployments (since you click through forms). However, the UI provides a nice visual overview of resources, cost, and logs in one place. Both methods support the core feature of auto-updating from the Git repo - that’s inherent to the Worker App Runner itself, not specific to SDK or UI.","Control vs. Ease: The SDK offers more fine-grained control programmatically - you can conditionally set parameters in code, loop through different deployments, or integrate with other Python logic. It’s also easier to incorporate into larger pipelines or tests. The UI offers ease of use - anyone with access can deploy without writing code, and it ensures all steps (including payment) are handled through a clean interface. It also might enforce some best practices (for example, cost approval) so you don’t accidentally deploy something without budgeting. In short, SDK = automation & flexibility, UI = simplicity & guided experience.","Use Cases: If you’re a developer doing rapid iterations on an app or doing internal testing, the SDK method shines - you can deploy from your IDE or terminal as part of your dev cycle. If you’re a CSP deploying an app for a customer or demonstrating something in a professional setting, the UI method is polished and transparent (on-chain records, UI status updates, etc.). Also, the UI currently is the only way for a CSP to deploy on behalf of clients with escrowed payments - it ties into the CSP smart contract and billing, which the SDK (as of now) is more for direct node control by an operator.","In many cases, you might use both: develop and test with the SDK for convenience, then use the Deeploy UI to deploy production jobs in a governed, auditable way on mainnet. The good news is both methods leverage the same Worker App Runner under the hood, so your app will behave the same in either case.","Q: Do I need to containerize my application or write a Dockerfile to use Worker App Runner?A: No - that’s the beauty of it! With Worker App Runner, you “bring your code, not a container.” You simply provide your Git repo and let the platform handle containerization on-the-fly[14][15]. You’ll specify a base image and build/run commands (which is kind of like an in-line Dockerfile), but you do not need to pre-build or host any container image yourself. This drastically simplifies deployment, especially for quick iterations or prototypes.","Q: What kinds of applications can I deploy with this?A: Virtually anything that can run in a container and be built with a script. Common examples include web servers, AI model inference servers, data processing jobs, APIs, etc. In our tutorial we showed a Node.js web app. You could deploy Python apps (just use a Python base image and appropriate pip install commands), Java applications (using a JDK base image), or any framework. As long as you can describe how to install dependencies and start the app, you can deploy it. Keep in mind the resources you request - e.g., if you need a GPU for AI, you can request one in the resource specs (assuming the node has a GPU available). The Worker App Runner is flexible: it’s effectively running a container that it builds for you using your instructions.","Q: How does the auto-update on commits work?A: The Worker App Runner sets up a background process that polls the Git repository for changes (by default every 60 seconds[12]). If it detects a new commit on the branch you specified, it will automatically fetch the latest code and re-run the build and run commands. The result is that your application in the container restarts with the new code. This is similar to a CI/CD pipeline deploying a new version, but it’s happening automatically on the edge node. If you have multiple nodes (e.g., for redundancy), each node would pull the update, ensuring your app is in sync across instances. Note: If you don’t want automatic redeploys, you could set a very high poll interval or manually control updates (future versions of Ratio1 might allow triggering updates via command).","Q: What if my repository is private? Is my code secure?A: You can deploy private repos by providing a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) in the vcs_data. The token will be used by the node to authenticate when cloning the repo. The token is transmitted securely to the node through the Ratio1 protocol. On the security side: your code is run on decentralized nodes, so you should treat it as you would with any cloud provider - the node operators might have the ability to see the code or output. Ratio1’s philosophy is “Your code stays yours”[16] in the sense that you’re not handing it to a centralized service permanently, and you can choose which nodes (even your own) run it. If confidentiality is a concern, you might run on permissioned nodes or wait for future enhancements like trusted execution environments. But for most use cases, it’s as secure as deploying to any server you control or trust.","Q: Can I store data or state with my application (e.g., databases, files)?A: Yes! The Worker App Runner inherits the capabilities of Ratio1’s Container App Runner, so you can mount volumes (persistent storage) if needed. In the SDK, we saw volumes and file_volumes parameters; in the Deeploy UI, there may be options to attach storage or use existing data sources. For a database, you could deploy a separate database service and connect your Worker App to it via network or environment variables. Or use hosted databases accessible over the internet (taking care with secure connections).","Q: What network access does the app have?A: By default, the app container will have outgoing internet access unless restricted by policy. If you enabled a tunnel (Cloudflare or ngrok), it has inbound access through that tunnel (so you get a public URL). Ratio1 uses Cloudflare Tunnels for security - your app isn’t exposed via a public IP directly, which adds a layer of protection. You can also set network policies to restrict egress if needed. Remember that if your app is a web service, you must either use the provided tunnel or handle networking differently; on Ratio1, nodes don’t just open a public port by default for jobs, it’s done via these secure tunnels.","Q: What happens when the job duration ends?A: When the time you paid for is up (say you funded 1 month of runtime), the job will be stopped by the network. In Ratio1’s design, the escrow holds the payment and releases it to the node operator over time as the job runs. If the time runs out or you manually stop the job early, the job container is stopped. You can always extend the duration by adding more funds (through the UI, by topping up the job) if you want it to keep running continuously. If you anticipate needing it longer, deploy with a longer duration or be ready to renew. The platform may later support auto-renewal features, but currently it’s manual to prevent overspending surprises.","The Worker App Runner truly streamlines the deployment of applications on Ratio1. Whether you’re a hands-on developer scripting deployments with the SDK, or a CSP leveraging the convenience of the Deeploy web portal, the message is the same: go from Git to running app with minimal effort. We eliminated the usual headaches - no need to maintain CI/CD pipelines, no container registry setup, and no complex infrastructure management. Ratio1’s decentralized platform takes care of containerizing your code, provisioning resources across edge nodes, and even updating your app when you push new code. This means you can focus on writing code and iterating on features, while Ratio1 handles the “Ops” part in the background.","In our tutorial, we saw a live example of deploying a web app directly from a GitHub repo and updating it via a simple git push. Both methods achieved this with just a few minutes of setup. This level of agility, combined with the power of decentralization (you’re not locked into a single cloud provider, and you have full transparency on how and where your app runs), is what makes Ratio1’s offering special. Your application can run close to users on edge nodes, with the assurance of on-chain governance and escrowed payments for trust. And you didn’t have to set up any of that manually - it was delivered as a service by the Ratio1 network.","We encourage you to give the Worker App Runner a try on a test network. If you’re already running a Ratio1 node, fire up the SDK and deploy a sample app - you’ll be amazed how quickly it comes alive. If you’re a CSP, consider deploying a demo app through Deeploy to showcase to your clients how fast things can go from concept to reality. The more you experiment, the more you’ll see the potential: continuous deployment, A/B testing with different branches, scaling out to multiple edge locations - all without leaving your coding environment or the friendly UI.","Ratio1 is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized DevOps, and the Worker App Runner is a prime example of that innovation. We hope this tutorial empowered you to take advantage of this tool.

Among the voices we also had our own Andrei Damian, founder of Ratio1.ai, who contributed to three pivotal panel discussions on AI-driven deepfakes, the balance of trust in everyday AI, and the convergence of AI with blockchain technology. Through these panels, we positioned Ratio1's innovations as key solutions to some of AI's pressing challenges, from verifying what's real in a sea of fakes to empowering users with trustless technology and marrying AI with blockchain for true accountability.","Deepfakes and AI-driven scams have turned online authenticity into a high-stakes whack-a-mole game. As soon as one deepfake detection method catches on, clever adversaries train new models to evade it. Traditional classifiers and fact-checkers struggle to keep pace with the speed and sophistication of these fabricated media. The result is an arms race where fakes often sprint ahead of the defenders, eroding public trust in everything from video evidence to voice recordings.","We address this challenge by flipping the script: instead of only trying to spot the fake, ensure we can always prove what's real. Thus Ratio1.ai's strategy centers on creating immutable proofs of authenticity for digital content. Every piece of data processed in the Ratio1 network is fingerprinted and stored in a tamper-proof way using R1FS, Ratio1's distributed file system. R1FS assigns each file a unique cryptographic hash and distributes it across the network, meaning any alteration to that file would instantly be detectable. Moreover, every AI model output or dataset comes tagged with the identity of the node that generated it, thanks to Node Deeds (Ratio1's on-chain node licenses) and the decentralized authentication layer called dAuth - all connected to on-chain immutable data via smart-contracts. In simple terms, only verified, licensed nodes can contribute content to the network, and their contributions are indelibly recorded. This way, if a video or audio clip comes through Ratio1, one can check its cryptographic proof of origin. If the fingerprints and signatures check out, the content is authentic - and if not, it's suspect by default. By emphasizing provenance over post-hoc detection, Ratio1 shifts the focus to verifying truth rather than constantly chasing the latest fake.","Detection hasn't been abandoned entirely, though. Ratio1 augments these authenticity proofs with decentralized forensic analysis conducted by its network of trustless oracle nodes. In the Ratio1 system, special oracles act like independent inspectors: they monitor network activity and can collectively analyze content for signs of manipulation. Because these oracles operate by consensus (no single oracle's word is “ground truth”), a deepfake would need to fool a majority of them - an exponentially harder feat than evading a lone detector. The oracles cross-verify data and model outputs circulating in the network, providing a distributed second opinion on whether something looks legitimate or malicious. Nevertheless the same approach can work with non-oracle nodes that might be running deep learning detection models - with or without GPU. Again, all their findings, along with each step of content handling, can be logged on an immutable ledger to create a forensic trail that cannot be tampered with. In practice, this means catching a deepfake isn't reliant on one company's AI model scanning uploads; it's a collective effort baked into the infrastructure itself. Ratio1's proposed approach turns the deepfake problem from an endless game of catch-up into a matter of checking facts against an unforgeable record.","This focus on authenticity and verification is one piece of the puzzle. The next step is addressing how we live with AI every day - finding the balance between trusting AI's help and maintaining healthy caution - a theme Damian tackled in the “Everyday AI” panel.","As AI assistants and algorithms seep into daily life, users and organizations find themselves teetering between trust and caution. On one hand, we're invited to rely on AI for everything from personal health advice to driving our cars; on the other, high-profile mistakes and opaque AI decisions urge us to be careful. The panel on “Everyday AI” zeroed in on this dilemma: How do we embrace AI's benefits without becoming blindly reliant? Conventional wisdom often says “just trust us” - a reassurance from big providers that they have things under control. But real confidence isn't built on PR soundbites or a corporate promise. It comes from knowing, at a technical level, that the AI systems we use can't betray our trust even if they wanted to.","We think that the key is building infrastructure that requires zero censorship or blind trust - in other words, removing the need to simply trust any one authority. In Ratio1's world, this means your data and AI interactions are protected by design. For example, our platform employs a stack called EDIL (Encrypted Decentralized Inference and Learning) to ensure that all computations on user data happen with the data fully encrypted. Imagine asking an AI a very sensitive question: under Ratio1, that query might be processed by many different nodes, but it remains gibberish to those nodes thanks to strong encryption. They can perform the computation and return an answer, yet never actually see your private information. This design - encapsulated in Ratio1's mantra “Your AI, your Data” - guarantees that no central company or rogue operator can peek at or censor what you're doing. In practical terms, it means an AI powered by Ratio1 can't be secretly programmed to withhold results or filter your queries based on an outside agenda, because the infrastructure simply doesn't permit such interference. In everyday use, this translates to users being confidently open with AI tools, knowing that their input stays private and the output is untainted by any hidden filters.","Securing privacy is only half the battle; ensuring reliable, unbiased service is the other. That's where Ratio1's Deeploy model comes in - a decentralized orchestration system that deploys AI models across the network without a single point of control. Traditional cloud services have a central brain (think of a Kubernetes control plane or a cloud scheduler) that decides which server runs your AI and can, in theory, pull the plug or alter the service at will. Deeploy replaces that with a community of nodes collectively deciding how to run your AI container, coordinated by blockchain consensus rather than a company's cloud manager. If one node drops out or misbehaves, others step in, guided by code and consensus rules instead of top-down commands. The result is an AI service that's remarkably resilient and free from unilateral control. For the everyday user, this means the AI applications they rely on are always available and operating under transparent, agreed-upon rules. There isn't a cloud admin who can invisibly throttle your AI assistant or scan your data, nor a corporation that might suddenly change the terms of service or censor certain queries. In Ratio1's framework, the infrastructure itself encourages the right balance of trust and caution: trust, because the system's openness and privacy guarantees have earned it; caution, because no external gatekeeper is empowered to meddle with the process, leaving you in control of your own data and AI usage.","Crucially, even a decentralized network needs accountability - and Ratio1 achieves that through what Damian calls permissioned trustless compliance. Every node in the Ratio1 network isn't just a random computer; it operates under a Node Deed license and a real-world identity verified through KYC (Know Your Customer) checks. In practice, this means the people running the AI nodes have skin in the game - they've proven who they are and agreed to uphold the network's standards. Yet the system doesn't simply rely on their goodwill. Thanks to the protocol's trustless design, all node actions are verified cryptographically and watched by the collective. If a node tries to deviate from the rules or tamper with data, it won't get very far: tasks won't be assigned to it, consensus won't validate its results, and its misbehavior will be evident to all other participants.","Everything that happens in this ecosystem is tracked with full provenance. From the origin of a dataset to the specific version of a model that produced a result, there's an immutable audit trail for it. Think of it as a black box recorder for AI operations, one that everyone on the network can query if needed. If something seems off - say an AI output that doesn't make sense or an unexpected decision - anyone can trace back through the logs and see which node handled it, which model was used, and whether all compliance checks and cryptographic validations passed. This level of transparency means users and companies don't have to take anyone's word for the system working correctly; they can verify it themselves. In day-to-day AI interactions, that brings peace of mind. You can comfortably rely on an AI-driven service, not because you've suppressed your caution, but because the system itself is built to be trustworthy. Real trust, as Damian emphasizes, comes from this marriage of decentralization and accountability: no secrets, no silent censorship, and no blind faith required.","By fostering trust through design rather than through authority, Ratio1 provides a blueprint for how everyday AI can and should operate. It's a vision where users feel in control and protected, which naturally leads to the next big question: Can blockchain technology help enforce this kind of trust and accountability on an even larger scale? That question was at the heart of the “AI and Blockchain” panel, where Damian explored whether decentralized intelligence is more than just industry buzz.","The phrase “AI and blockchain” often raises skeptical eyebrows, and for good reason - as (too) many have slapped these terms together without delivering real value. But on this panel, our CEO made a compelling case that this combo, when done right, is far more than hype. At its core, a blockchain is about trust through transparency, and AI, especially when spread across many players, desperately needs exactly that. Without an immutable record of who did what, when, and how, a distributed AI system would have no real accountability. Imagine a network of independent AI models making decisions or predictions: if there's no tamper-proof log of those activities, how would we trace errors or abuses when something goes wrong? “Without immutable proofs, there's no accountability” - meaning we'd be back to square one, forced to blindly trust some central authority or intermediary. Blockchain provides the antidote: a permanent, uneditable ledger that can hold proof of each AI action, decision, or contribution. Rather than being a buzzword pairing, the marriage of AI and blockchain is about injecting a dose of verifiable truth into the AI ecosystem so that even a global network of AI services can remain honest and auditable.","Ratio1 demonstrates this principle in action by weaving blockchain-based smart contracts and token economics into the fabric of its AI platform. Practically speaking, every critical operation in the Ratio1 network is governed or audited by smart contract code. Take payments for example: instead of a client paying a provider directly (and simply hoping the provider delivers the AI service as promised), Ratio1 uses escrow smart contracts that automatically hold payments and release them only when the work is verified. If you request an AI analysis via Ratio1, you deposit the fee into a program on the blockchain; the nodes that perform the analysis get paid only once the network's oracles confirm that the task was completed correctly. This creates a trustless assurance - users know they will get what they paid for, and providers know they'll be paid for what they deliver, without a third-party mediator.","Moreover, Ratio1 introduces a novel incentive mechanism called Proof-of-AI (PoAI) to reward useful work. In essence, the network measures and rewards actual AI computations performed by nodes. Rather than “mining” a cryptocurrency by solving pointless puzzles, Ratio1 nodes earn R1 utility tokens by proving they have genuinely run AI models or processed data as requested. Every bit of work - a model trained, an inference made, a dataset processed - produces a cryptographic proof that gets logged on-chain. The smart contracts then tally these proofs and dispense token rewards accordingly. This tokenized incentive aligns everyone's interests: the more real AI work a node does for the community, the more it earns, and all of it is enforced by code without needing human oversight. There's no need to trust a company's accounting or a cloud provider's opaque metrics; the blockchain transactions make it clear who did the work and ensure they get their fair share. It's a self-regulating economic loop that turns the network into a living marketplace for AI services, governed by transparency.","Behind the scenes, Ratio1 runs on modern blockchain infrastructure that makes this micro-economy possible. The platform is built on a fast, Layer-2 network (in fact, Coinbase's Base chain) that is optimized for high throughput and minimal fees. This choice is crucial: microtransactions are the lifeblood of a decentralized AI ecosystem. If every time an AI model answered a query you had to pay a hefty transaction fee, the system wouldn't get off the ground. Instead, Ratio1's use of a high-speed, low-cost blockchain means these payments and proof recordings can happen continuously in tiny increments, without anyone noticing a cost overhead. It enables a microtransaction-based ecosystem at scale - essentially a new economy for AI services.","An independent developer, for instance, could deploy a small AI model on Ratio1 and charge only fractions of a cent each time someone uses it, with payments flowing in real time. Data providers could be automatically rewarded every time their dataset contributes to improving a model's predictions. And because the blockchain ensures all parties play by the rules, there could be hundreds of thousands of such interactions per day, all settled accurately with no central broker taking a cut. The concept of “zero-fee” isn't far off - in effect, the friction of transacting is so low that it doesn't hinder innovation or participation. This opens the door to AI marketplaces and collaborative networks that simply weren't feasible under traditional cloud economics. Small contributions can be monetized; niche AI models can find their audience and compensation; and users pay only for what they actually use, all with cryptographic guarantees under the hood.","So, is decentralized intelligence just a buzzword or a real paradigm shift? Ratio1's approach firmly sides with the latter. By anchoring AI operations to an immutable ledger and rewarding genuine contributions, it creates an ecosystem that is both self-governing and self-sustaining. Accountability is baked in: every model run, every result, and every token exchange is transparent and traceable. This means that even as AI systems grow more complex and autonomous, we maintain a clear chain of responsibility and incentive. The blockchain isn't there for glamour - it's there to guarantee that a global, decentralized AI network can function smoothly without a trusted overseer.","In the narrative Andrei Damian shared at AI Expo Europe, AI and blockchain together form a kind of checks-and-balances system for the future of technology. The hype fades when you see the practical benefits: developers and users can engage with AI services without needing to blindly trust each other, and new economic models can flourish around AI innovation. In short, decentralized intelligence is not just a buzzword for Ratio1 - it's a vision of AI that is as accountable and resilient as it is powerful. And judging by the buzz around Ratio1's contributions at the conference, it's a future that many in the industry are eager to embrace.","Petrica Butusina","Nov 6, 2025","‹ Monthly Report - October 2025","Ratio1 as the Missing Link in the AI x Crypto Convergence ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

This boosted our network, visibility, and led to new strategic contacts.","We forged consortium partnerships to co-develop proposals for two EU Horizon Europe calls: HORIZON-CL3-2025-02-ECCC-01 (Generative AI for Cybersecurity) and HORIZON-CL3-2025-02-ECCC-02 (Operational Cybersecurity tools). These collaborations unite Ratio1 with leading European universities and established industry partners in a push to apply our decentralized AI tech to large-scale security challenges.","Emphasis was placed on broad alliances - partnering with top academic institutions and corporate innovators across multiple countries - truly making October \"The (1st) Month of Partnerships\" for Ratio1 (many more to come though).","Technology & Protocol Evolution:","Rolled out RAG-as-a-Service (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) within the Ratio1 stack. This new service (built on our J33VES framework) lets developers easily deploy LLM-powered assistants that perform grounded Q&A over private knowledge bases stored on R1FS. By enabling secure retrieval-augmented generation on our decentralized storage, Ratio1 now offers \"grounded answers over large knowledge bases\" as a service - enhancing AI capabilities while keeping data encrypted and self-sovereign.","The Deeploy orchestration engine saw improvements for smoother job management. Building on September’s v2 release (with features like on-the-fly job editing and automated escrow settlement), October brought further enhancements: more granular scheduling controls, enriched monitoring/metrics, and an even more user-friendly UI for Cloud Service Providers including CSP and Node Operator profiles and statistics! These updates simplify how CSPs launch and manage workloads, reinforcing Ratio1’s goal of web2 simplicity atop web3 infrastructure.","Upgrades to ChainDist (Ratio1’s distributed scheduler) added performance optimizations and broader hardware support - our blockchain-powered engine that replaces a traditional centralized scheduler. This means Ratio1 workloads can now be orchestrated across heterogeneous nodes, from data-center servers to low-power AI devices, without missing a beat.","Application Ecosystem Growth:","Partner Keysoft launched Keytrial, a cloud platform for clinical trials (CRO) management (accessible at https://keytrial.keysoftlinks.com) using Ratio1 as the backbone. Our team provided infrastructure and deployment support to bring this product live. KeyTrail facilitates the design and tracking of clinical studies, leveraging Ratio1’s secure storage and compute so that sensitive trial data remains encrypted in R1FS and computations run reliably on decentralized nodes. This launch underscores how enterprise partners can rely on Ratio1 for mission-critical healthcare applications. (Keysoft was already an early adopter - last month they used Ratio1’s J33VES to power AI assistants with encrypted data and decentralized identity. Now, with KeyTrail, they’ve extended their use of Ratio1 into healthcare solutions.)","We also assisted SmartClover (a Ratio1 CSP partner) in deploying CerviGuard, an AI-driven cervical cancer screening tool built on the Ratio1 framework. CerviGuard utilizes deep learning models to analyze medical images for early detection of cervical cancer, while harnessing Ratio1’s privacy-preserving features. Patient data never leaves local clinics; instead, the tool uses federated learning and homomorphic encryption so that only encrypted model updates are shared and aggregated on-chain. This approach - first demonstrated in our CerviSafe PoC - is now a real-world product, showing how Ratio1 enables secure, decentralized healthcare AI. CerviGuard’s deployment on our network highlights end-to-end support: from model training on edge nodes to on-chain result verification, all within the Ratio1 ecosystem.","Community & Outreach:","We launched the Ratio1 Talks Series - a weekly discussion format where our team explores the vision, technology, and community behind Ratio1. These open sessions aim to foster transparency, share progress directly with our ecosystem, and create a space for knowledge exchange around decentralized AI, R1 tokenomics, and real-world applications. The first episodes covered topics like network utility, protocol design, and event insights from Lugano Plan ₿ and the Clinical Research Summit.","October 2025 earned the moniker \"Month of the Partnerships\" for Ratio1. In addition to advancing our technology, we placed heavy focus on collaboration this month - both within the blockchain community and in formal R&D initiatives.","The Ratio1 executive team’s participation in Lugano’s Plan ₿ Forum (a premier Bitcoin & decentralization conference) was a highlight of the month. The event drew a global audience of technologists, investors, and policymakers, and notably expanded its scope to decentralized AI this yeart. Our presence allowed us to showcase Ratio1 as a cutting-edge \"AI OS\" powered by blockchain, aligning with the forum’s theme of bridging decentralized finance and emerging technologies. Through panels and networking sessions, we connected with potential partners and evangelized the benefits of trustless AI computing. The buzz around Ratio1’s approach at Plan ₿ has already opened doors to new communities and collaborators in the crypto and AI space.","Building on last quarter’s outreach, Ratio1 has now formed consortia with esteemed European partners to pursue funding under Horizon Europe’s Cluster-3 calls. In October we solidified partnerships for two security-focused calls: HORIZON-CL3-2025-02-ECCC-01: \"Generative AI for Cybersecurity Applications\" and HORIZON-CL3-2025-02-CS-ECCC-02: \"New Advanced Tools and Processes for Operational Cybersecurity.\" These EU-backed projects (each with multi-million euro budgets) aim to develop next-generation cybersecurity solutions - a mission well-matched to Ratio1’s capabilities in secure, distributed AI. Our role in the proposals is to provide decentralized AI infrastructure: from edge compute nodes for distributed model training to encrypted storage (R1FS) for sensitive threat intelligence data, and Proof-of-AI validation to ensure trust in the computations. We have teamed up with leading academic institutions (including one of Europe’s top technical universities) and established corporations in the cybersecurity domain to strengthen these bids.","Should these proposals be approved, Ratio1 would become a core technology provider in multi-country R&D efforts, integrating our platform into real-world use cases at continental scale. Even at the proposal stage, the process has fostered deep relationships with over a dozen organizations across Europe - from AI research labs to defense tech SMEs. These partnerships reflect the growing interest in trustless AI; by collaborating with Ratio1, our partners plan to leverage decentralized compute and blockchain transparency to tackle security challenges in ways not possible with traditional cloud setups.","In short, October’s consortium-building has positioned Ratio1 at the forefront of Europe’s push for secure and privacy-preserving AI. This not only bolsters our credibility but also aligns us with emerging EU standards and funding streams for AI innovation.","October also saw significant progress in Ratio1’s core technology stack, with new services and updates that improve both functionality and reach of our platform.","We are excited to announce the deployment of Retrieval-Augmented Generation as a Service (RAGaaS) within Ratio1. This capability is delivered through our J33VES intelligent agent framework and tightly integrated with Ratio1’s decentralized storage (R1FS). In practice, RAGaaS allows any developer or partner to easily create AI assistants that can retrieve knowledge from private data and generate context-rich answers - all within the secure, trustless confines of the Ratio1 network. For example, a support chatbot can now pull facts from an organization’s documents (stored encrypted on R1FS) and answer user queries with grounded responses, rather than relying solely on a base LLM’s training data. The entire retrieval and generation pipeline runs on Ratio1’s nodes, meaning no central server ever sees the full query or data. This built-in RAG service dramatically lowers the barrier for enterprises to deploy custom Q&A or decision-support bots that are both knowledgeable and privacy-preserving. As noted in our roadmap, RAGaaS is a key milestone that enables developers to offer their own \"ask-my-data\" AI services on top of Ratio1. Early internal tests show that combining J33VES with R1FS indexing yields highly relevant results without compromising data ownership - fulfilling our vision of secure LLM integration in enterprise workflows.","Our Deeploy engine - the web-based orchestration portal for containerized jobs - received iterative upgrades this month to enhance usability and control. Following September’s major v2 release (which introduced automated job lifecycle management, real-time job editing, and transparent burn/invoice reports), the team focused on refinements driven by user feedback. Notably, we added advanced scheduling options: CSPs can now schedule jobs to start at specific times or set up recurring deployments, improving automation for routine workloads. We also improved the monitoring and metrics dashboard within Deeploy, giving users deeper insight into their running jobs (e.g. per-node resource usage, execution logs, and live performance metrics across the decentralized cluster). These additions help CSPs fine-tune their deployments and quickly respond to any issues. On the backend, Deeploy’s job dispatcher was optimized for faster container spin-up and smarter placement decisions - leveraging ChainDist enhancements (see below) to minimize latency by selecting optimal nodes based on real-time network conditions. Together, these new capabilities make running complex workloads on Ratio1 even more seamless, approaching the convenience of traditional cloud orchestration but with the resilience and transparency of decentralization. As always, security remains paramount: the dAuth identity layer and PoAI escrow logic continue to enforce that only authorized jobs execute and that payments settle trustlessly on-chain.","The Ratio1 ecosystem continues to expand, with our partners launching innovative applications on the platform this month. These real-world deployments demonstrate how Ratio1’s technology translates into value in various sectors, from enterprise software to healthcare.","This October, Keysoft (one of our flagship enterprise partners) officially launched Keytrial, a clinical trials management system built on Ratio1. KeyTrail is a web-based platform designed to streamline clinical studies - handling everything from patient enrollment and consent tracking to data collection across multiple research sites. For a solution like this, reliability, data security, and compliance are paramount. That’s why Keysoft turned to Ratio1’s infrastructure to power KeyTrail’s backend. Our team worked closely with Keysoft to deploy the KeyTrail application onto Ratio1’s decentralized network and ensure it meets the rigorous demands of clinical operations. The platform’s databases and files are stored in R1FS (Ratio1 File System), meaning patient records and trial data are encrypted and sharded across nodes rather than kept in a single server or cloud vendor. This offers strong data integrity and privacy protection out of the box. Moreover, by running the application on multiple decentralized nodes, KeyTrail achieves high uptime and resilience - a critical factor when doctors and researchers need 24/7 access to trial information. If one node goes offline, another node can seamlessly take over, avoiding downtime. Ratio1’s Deeploy orchestration also simplified the rollout: we used container templates and our escrow system to quickly spin up the various microservices that make up KeyTrail, with automatic load balancing across nodes. For Keysoft, this meant they could go live without investing in expensive new servers or cloud contracts - instead, they leverage our network of community-run nodes with transparent on-chain accounting for usage. KeyTrail’s launch is a milestone for Ratio1 as well: it showcases an enterprise healthcare application running entirely on decentralized infrastructure. This not only validates our platform’s maturity but also opens the door for further adoption in regulated industries. (It’s worth noting that Keysoft’s journey with Ratio1 started earlier - last month they deployed AI assistants using our J33VES framework. With KeyTrail, they have expanded into healthcare SaaS, underscoring the versatility of Ratio1 for different use cases.) We anticipate that the success of KeyTrail will attract other software providers in biotech and pharma to consider Ratio1 for their needs, especially where data security and cross-organization collaboration are key concerns.","Another exciting addition to the ecosystem is CerviGuard.link, a cervical cancer screening tool developed by SmartClover, one of our Cloud Service Provider partners. CerviGuard aims to assist medical professionals by using deep learning to analyze cervical scan images (such as Pap smear slides) and identify early signs of abnormality. What makes CerviGuard special is its deployment model: it is built on top of the Ratio1 framework to prioritize patient privacy and distributed processing. Rather than sending sensitive medical images to a central cloud, CerviGuard utilizes Ratio1’s decentralized compute to bring the AI to the data source. Here’s how it works in practice: clinics run Ratio1 nodes (managed by SmartClover as the CSP) on-site or in-country, and these nodes handle the image processing and model inference locally. The federated learning approach means that the AI model is trained collaboratively across multiple clinics’ nodes without aggregating raw patient data in one place. Each node trains on its own subset of encrypted images and periodically shares encrypted model updates (not the images themselves) to a global model via the Ratio1 network. Using our EDIL (Encrypted Decentralized Inference and Learning) framework, the system can combine these updates into a refined global model, and send that model back to each clinic’s node. The result is a highly accurate screening AI that learns from a wide population while respecting privacy - individual data never leaves the hospital premises unencrypted. Additionally, all training and inference transactions are immutably logged on-chain (via Proof-of-AI), providing an audit trail for regulatory compliance.","In\t October, SmartClover, with our support, deployed CerviGuard to an initial set of healthcare providers as a pilot. The deployment leveraged Ratio1’s ChainDist scheduler to distribute model training tasks across participating nodes and used R1FS for storing encrypted parameters and results. Early feedback is extremely positive: clinics appreciate that they retain ownership of data and can run AI analyses without relying on an internet connection to a distant server. For patients, this means AI-assisted screening can be done in local clinics with state-of-the-art accuracy, all while their data stays protected. From Ratio1’s perspective, CerviGuard is a powerful validation of our platform in the digital health arena. It extends the concept proven by our CerviSafe proof-of-concept - that Ratio1 can enable privacy-preserving health diagnostics at scale. As CerviGuard moves from TRL6 pilot to production, it could serve as a blueprint for other healthcare solutions (e.g. in radiology or pathology) to be built on Ratio1.","We are proud to support SmartClover in this initiative and view it as perfectly aligned with our mission to use decentralized AI for social good.","In October, we also kicked off the Ratio1 Talks Series, a new internal-external communication initiative that brings our team’s insights directly to the community. Each episode features Ratio1 contributors discussing our technology stack, real-world use cases, and the broader context of decentralized AI. Topics this month ranged from the origin of the Ratio1 Protocol and the R1 token, to partner integrations and event experiences like Lugano Plan ₿ and the Clinical Research Summit. The Talks Series not only documents our progress in real time but also fosters open dialogue, helping partners and users better understand how Ratio1 connects blockchain, AI, and real-world applications.","With October’s achievements, Ratio1 is entering the final stretch of 2025 on a strong footing. Our aggressive focus on partnerships is already bearing fruit: the connections made at Lugano’s Plan ₿ Forum and the Horizon Europe consortia are expected to formalize into concrete projects and collaborations in the coming months. Success in the EU calls, in particular, could see Ratio1 playing a central role in continent-wide cybersecurity innovation - an outcome that would significantly expand our user base and credibility. On the technology front, the deployment of RAG-as-a-Service and the enhancements to Deeploy/ChainDist enrich our platform’s feature set, making it more attractive and accessible to both developers and enterprise customers. We will continue to iterate on these capabilities to maintain our competitive edge.","In summary, October 2025 was a pivotal month defined by partnership and progress. By coupling technical breakthroughs with strategic alliances, Ratio1 is steadily transforming from a promising platform into a vibrant ecosystem. We thank all our collaborators, node operators, and community members for being part of this journey. The foundation laid this month positions us to close the year with strong results and step confidently into 2026 as a frontrunner in decentralized AI computing.","Petrica Butusina","Nov 7, 2025","‹ Ratio1 SDK for TypeScript: Your bridge to Edge Nodes","Ratio1 at AI Expo Europe: Fighting Deepfakes, Building Everyday AI Trust, and Uniting AI with Blockchain ›","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

With the release of edge-sdk-ts and cstore-auth-ts, Node.js and frontend teams can connect directly to CStore (our redis-like state fabric) and R1FS (our IPFS-inspired file system) without leaving their comfort zone. The two packages combine into a practical toolkit for building decentralized apps, partner integrations, and customer-facing experiences on top of Ratio1 in days instead of weeks.","Ratio1 exists to make decentralized AI infrastructure accessible to every builder, not just Python specialists or infrastructure veterans. This release delivers on that promise in two complementary ways:","edge-sdk-ts finally gives JavaScript teams a type-safe, batteries-included doorway into CStore and R1FS, so they can call Ratio1 services without reverse-engineering edge-node APIs or maintaining custom fetch wrappers.","cstore-auth-ts layers a plug-and-play authentication system on top of CStore, letting teams persist users, passwords, and metadata entirely on Ratio1 without rolling an external database.","Together, the TypeScript community can now build on Ratio1 primitives with the ergonomics they expect while inheriting the decentralization, security, and observability baked into every edge node.","@ratio1/edge-sdk-ts gives you a fully typed gateway into the services exposed by Ratio1 edge nodes. It ships with dual entry points: createEdgeSdk for Node.js runtimes and createEdgeSdkBrowserClient for browser and SSR frameworks, so you can share business logic across environments.","The SDK is engineered to fit wherever your JavaScript runs: it embraces traditional Node.js services, Next.js App Router handlers, and the containers that execute workloads on Ratio1 edge nodes. And the full suite of endpoints exposed by the APIs is faithfully reproduced in the library, so you have full access to all the capabilities of CStore and R1FS.","Because the client reads its configuration from the standard Ratio1 environment variables (EE_CHAINSTORE_API_URL and EE_R1FS_API_URL inside containers), it drops straight into existing node deployments. You can also pass URLs explicitly when running locally or inside partner infrastructure.","Need a local sandbox while you build? Pair the SDK with r1-plugins-sandbox to emulate edge-node APIs on your laptop, perfect for rapid tests before you hit a real node (check out Go Developers, Meet the New Ratio1 SDK and Sandbox for more details).","Here is how straightforward it feels to interact with CStore and R1FS:","Sitting on top of edge-sdk-ts is @ratio1/cstore-auth-ts, a plug-and-play authentication layer that keeps user credentials and metadata inside CStore hashes. It bootstraps an admin account via environment variables, enforces password hashing, and gives you strict username validation out of the box.","Initialization is intentionally frictionless: one call to auth.simple.init() will check for the admin account and, if necessary, create it using the bootstrap password defined in EE_CSTORE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PW. Every credential is stored in a structured, versioned format: usernames are canonicalized, password hashes are salted and peppered, and metadata travels alongside the credential record so you can stash profile details, feature flags, or tenant descriptors without leaking sensitive material. Because the library stays headless, it slips comfortably into API routes, CLI automation, or partner integrations while keeping its responsibilities limited to storage, hashing, and validation.","And when you layer authentication into the picture, it stays just as clean:","Bringing the two libraries together gives teams a reproducible blueprint:","Install the packages: npm install @ratio1/edge-sdk-ts @ratio1/cstore-auth-ts.","Expose credentials: point the SDKs to your edge node with EE_CHAINSTORE_API_URL, EE_R1FS_API_URL, EE_CSTORE_AUTH_HKEY, EE_CSTORE_AUTH_SECRET, and EE_CSTORE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PW.","Bootstrap auth: run a tiny script (or a setup endpoint) that calls auth.simple.init() once.","Publish APIs: wire authentication, profile storage, and file workflows into Express, Fastify or Next.js API routes.","Ship a UI: hydrate React components or partner portals with CID-backed file listings and metadata-driven access control.","The toolkit scales from simple username/password flows to multi-tenant dashboards. Because everything lives on top of Ratio1 edge nodes, your application inherits the same decentralization guarantees: sharded storage, cryptographic addressing, cross-node replication, and watchdog oracles that keep services honest.","Opening Ratio1's primitives to TypeScript does more than simplify developer onboarding. It unlocks partner integrations - billing portals, observability dashboards, industry-specific orchestration layers - that can now plug into CStore and R1FS using familiar idioms. It lets CSPs and partners onboard clients faster, knowing authentication is a reusable module. And it gives product teams permission to target web, mobile, and desktop simultaneously without rewriting core logic.","Explore the source: @ratio1/edge-sdk-ts and @ratio1/cstore-auth-ts.","npm install both packages and connect them to your edge node or partner deployment.","Share what you build in Discord: templates, plugins, and workflows help the ecosystem grow sharper together.","The Ratio1 edge is now open territory for TypeScript developers.

It integrates trustless microtransactions into its ecosystem, promoting a secure, efficient, and scalable network for AI development and deployment. This underscores the project's dedication to technological advancement while prioritizing financial growth and sustainability.","The tokenomics of the Ratio1 are meticulously designed to enhance the ecosystem's durability and expansion. As a core utility ERC-20 token, the Ratio1 Protocol token functions as the principal currency facilitating transactions throughout the network. This tokenomics framework aims to reward all ecosystem contributors — developers, node operators, and users alike — encouraging active participation and sustained growth.","Since the Ratio1 Protocol token operates as a utility token rather than a security token, its primary function lies in facilitating operational activities within the Ratio1 ecosystem, rather than speculative trading. It empowers users to contribute computing power, access diverse services, deploy applications, and eventually partake in governance processes. Consequently, there has not been, nor is there any intention for, a Token Generation Event (TGE) or Initial Coin/Token Offering (ICO/IDO) associated with the Ratio1 Protocol token. All tokens, including those held in the Foundation's treasury, are distributed through Ratio1 Edge Node (REN) licenses (Node Deeds) and the Ratio1 Protocol decentralized application (dApp). These Node Deeds come in three forms: Genesis Node Deed (GND), Master Node Deed (MND), and Node Deed (ND).","NOTICE: The token reward system serves as an authentic Artificial Intelligence mining mechanism. It incentivizes your node's contribution, whether it's a personal PC, cloud VM, or data center hardware, to various aspects such as AI training, inference, endpoint provisioning, business rules execution, and protocol security. Your role, akin to manual labor, entails supplying power, provisioning hardware, installing software, maintaining the computer(s), and connecting the node(s) to the Internet, thereby supporting the protocol.","The Genesis Node Deed (GND), a one-time issuance exclusive to the Ratio1 Protocol Foundation, activates \"edge node zero\" the Foundation's virtual compute node. This activation is essential for generating tokens allocated to the publicly disclosed Foundation token pools described below. In essence, the GND acts as the cornerstone for launching the entire Ratio1 Protocol ecosystem.","A specialized node license that will be allocated to both the development team and initial investors. This deed plays a pivotal role in supporting and sustaining the core functions of the ecosystem. The emission period for MND spans over a duration of more than 30 months and it starts 223 epochs after the smart contract deployment.","MND licenses cannot mine Proof of AI. MND owners - founders - must purchase NDs if they want to mine Proof of AI (rewards generated from protocol usage). Their oracle processing is for the good of the community besides their Proof of Availability (initial rewards).","This license is available for public purchase and enables the operation of individual edge nodes within the Ratio1 Protocol ecosystem. These nodes are essential for powering and maintaining the network's decentralized infrastructure. Unlike the emission strategy for MNDs, NDs are emitted at a faster rate, ensuring a longer vesting period (36 months).","Our utility token is intricately designed to serve as the fuel for the Ratio1 Protocol ecosystem, enabling a smooth and efficient operation across various functionalities. Here is an enhanced clarification of the utility token’s purpose and limitations:","Defined Utility: The token acts as the operational gas required for processing jobs, allocating compute time, provisioning GPU resources, and acquiring licenses. It is essential for all transactional processes within the protocol, ensuring that each action is executed seamlessly.","No Financial Entitlements: Holders of the token will not receive any form of financial returns such as dividends, profit shares, interest, or other benefits typically associated with investments in the DeFi space. The token is strictly a utility mechanism within the Ratio1 Protocol.","Exclusively Non-Investment: The primary function of our token is to facilitate transactions within the Ratio1 Protocol’s ecosystem. It is specifically designed to support operational efficiency and is not intended for speculative trading or as an investment vehicle.","The Ratio1 Protocol treasury encompasses multiple pools designed to delineate the scope of resource allocation.","Dedicated to funding ongoing research and development efforts that are central to the advancement of the Ratio1 Protocol. Investments from this pool ensure continuous innovation, improvement of existing technologies, and development of new functionalities within the protocol. It supports the technical team in enhancing the platform's capabilities and security features.","Resources in this pool are allocated towards marketing initiatives and community engagement strategies.

By funding these activities, Ratio1 encourages innovation and practical implementation of ideas that can enhance the ecosystem. This not only stimulates creativity within the community but also helps in identifying and nurturing potential projects that could be integrated into the Ratio1 Protocol Marketplace.","Dedicated to initiatives that align with the Ratio1 Protocol’s commitment to ethical practices and positive social impact. This includes contributions to causes such as sustainability projects, educational programs, and other community-enhancing projects. Through this pool, Ratio1 demonstrates its commitment to using technology for societal benefit and to promoting responsible AI and blockchain practices.","The Ratio1 Protocol features a robust tokenomics structure with a fixed total supply of 161,803,398 tokens, a figure inspired by the Golden Ratio - a mathematical constant observed in natural and human-made structures, from the spirals of galaxies to the design of artworks and molecular structures. This number not only highlights the protocol’s dedication to balance and sustainability but also symbolizes its commitment to organic growth and technological evolution. Finally, for us this particular number signifies the human-centric approach for advancement of AI and blockchain technologies.","Unique to our approach is the absence of token generation events such as TGEs or ICO/IDO events. Instead, the entire token supply will be fully mined, released through the contribution of computational power by participants who operate edge nodes. This method ensures a finite and transparent token distribution from the start, aligning with our goal of a fully decentralized and participant-driven ecosystem.","Token distribution is intricately designed around the issuance of licenses, referred to as Node Deeds, available in three distinct forms. This framework supports our protocol’s philosophy and operational dynamics, fostering an equitable and scalable network.","Category","Private sale: partners / key investors","Private sale: smart money","Advisors, influencers, advocates","DEX pool","CEX pool","DEX extra pool","Founding team","Internal R&D Pool WALLET","Internal Marketing Pool WALLET","R&D - grants* Pool WALLET","Social WALLET","PoAI (partial), PoO, PoA ***","Percentage","1.60%","9.00%","4.00%","0.32%","7.00%","0.40%","11.50%","2.18%","10.00%","5.00%","45.00%","Price per token","$0.1","$0.2","$0.3","Token source","MND","GND","ND **","No. of NFT","160","900","400","1,150","5,000","No. of ND","No. of MND","*separate from other grants that will be attracted in the ecosystem**the normal non-master Node Deeds will be released based on anti-inflationary policy with gradually increasing sale price.

Following the distrib of proposed share all jobs will be rewarded only based on initiator funds","The Ratio1 Protocol employs a unique anti-inflationary pricing strategy for its Node Deeds, which are essential NFT-licenses for each Edge Node within the ecosystem. This method systematically increases the cost of Node Deeds as more are purchased, ensuring that only genuine economic factors drive their acquisition. This tiered pricing model is designed to mitigate speculative buying and promote a stable growth environment for the network. For instance, the \"Universal (no zone boundary)\" Node Deed starts at a price of $500 during the first tier with 89 units available. As demand increases and these initial units are sold, the price escalates to $750 in the second tier for the next 144 units, and further to $1,000 for 233 units in the third tier. This pattern of escalation continues across subsequent tiers, with prices sharply increasing up to $9,500 by tier 12. Each tier follows a similar progression, reflecting the protocol’s commitment to controlling inflation and ensuring that Node Deeds are acquired for their intended utility rather than speculative purposes.","The approach not only aligns with Ratio1’s ethos of democratizing AI via blockchain but also ensures that the growth of the network is economically sustainable. By increasing prices as more deeds are purchased, Ratio1 effectively controls the rate of expansion, aligns Node Deed ownership with actual usage and contribution to the ecosystem, and secures the network's long-term viability. This strategy exemplifies a thoughtful integration of economic principles with technological innovation, aiming to foster a robust and equitable ecosystem.","Tier","T1","T2","T3","T4","T5","T6","T7","T8","T9","T10","T11","T12","Totals","USD","$500","$750","$1,000","$1,500","$2,000","$2,500","$3,000","$3,500","$4,000","$5,000","$7,000","$9,500","Units","89","144","233","377","610","987","1,597","2,584","4,181","6,765","10,946","17,711","46,224","Value","$44,500","$108,000","$233,000","$565,500","$1,220,000","$2,467,500","$4,791,000","$9,044,000","$16,724,000","$35,197,500","$76,622,000","$168,254,500","$315,271,500","The Ultimate AI OS Powered by Blockchain Technology","Useful Links","Pitch Decks","Media Kit","FAQ","Ambassadors","Status","Social","Discord","X","Linkedin","Youtube","Telegram EN","Telegram ANN","©Ratio1 2025.

The Node Deeds enable their holders to operate individual edge nodes, contribute compute power to the Ratio 1 Protocol, and mine utility tokens (\"Tokens\") through their activity in the Ratio 1 Ecosystem (\"Ecosystem\") , as described in the  White Paper available on the URL address at ratio1.ai/whitepaper ( the ‘’Website’’).","The Node Deeds are acquired from NAEURAL SRL, a company incorporated under the laws of Romania, registered with the Trade Registry under number 40/12133/2024, having fiscal code 50252500, with registered office at 61 Eufrosina Popescu Street, Section \"LAMA 2\", Space No. 1, Entrance B, 1st Floor, Room 42, District 3, Bucharest (\"Company\", \"We\", \"Us\", or \"Our\").","By acquiring, holding, or using a Node Deed, you (\"You\", \"Your\", ‘’Holder’’ or \"Purchaser\"), agree to be bound by these Terms. Please read these Terms carefully. If You do not agree to these Terms, you must not purchase, hold or use the Node Deed.","Your acquisition of and/or operation of the Node Deed constitutes your full and unconditional agreement to these Terms. We may update these Terms by providing a new version online and your continued use of the Our website located at URL address  https://ratio1.ai/docs  and the Ecosystem after any such update constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. These Terms represent a binding contract between You and Us.","By accessing or using the Ecosystem (including the Node Deeds ), You are accepting these Terms (on behalf the entity that you represent), and You represent and warrant that You have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into these Terms (on behalf of the entity that you represent). You further represent and warrant that You are otherwise legally permitted to acquire and hold the Node Deed in your jurisdiction.","2. Nature and Utility of Node Deeds","2.1 Utility Purpose","Node Deeds are licenses that enable the operation of individual edge nodes within the Ratio 1 Protocol. They grant to the Holder the right to:","a) Use the Ratio 1 Protocol for AI processing tasks;","b) Contribute compute power to the Ecosystem;","c) Mine Tokens based on the Holder’s activity as a node provider.","Node Deeds are strictly utility-based and are designed to facilitate participation in the Ecosystem’s decentralized AI network, enhancing security, transparency, and decentralized data management.","2.2 Not Security Tokens","Node Deeds are not security tokens under applicable laws. Node Deeds do not represent ownership, equity, profit-sharing, dividends, or any investment expectation in the Company or the Ecosystem. Purchasers acknowledge that Node Deeds are not linked with any expectation of profit or financial return and that any Tokens mined are solely based on the Purchaser’s active participation in operating a node.","In Our view, the Node Deeds do not meet the criteria of an \"investment contract\" under the Howey Test, as established by the U.S. Supreme Court in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (1946). The Howey Test defines a security as involving (1) an investment of money, (2) in a common enterprise, (3) with an expectation of profits, (4) solely from the efforts of others.","Node Deeds fail to satisfy the Howey Test because:","(i)  No Expectation of Profits: the Node Deeds are utility licenses, and any Tokens mined depend on the Purchaser’s active operation of a node, not passive investment;","(ii) No Profits Solely from Efforts of Others: Rewards are generated through the Purchaser’s own computational efforts, not the Company’s or third parties’ management;","(iii) No Common Enterprise: The Ecosystem operates as a decentralized network where rewards are tied to individual node performance, not pooled profits.","The Company has not structured the Node Deeds as securities, and the Purchasers acknowledge that they are acquiring Node Deeds for their utility in the Ecosystem, not for speculative investment.","The sale and use/operation of Node Deeds do not require the Company to hold any specific securities licenses in the EU or USA, as Node Deeds are utility-based licenses and not financial instruments or securities. Purchasers are responsible for ensuring compliance with any local laws applicable to their purchase  and/or use of Node Deeds.","Please note that the Node Deeds may be purchased by legal entities (e.g., companies, corporations, partnerships) duly organized and validly existing under the laws of their jurisdiction. Legal entities must have the authority to enter into these Terms and comply with applicable laws, including AML and KYC requirements.","3. Acquisition of Node Deeds","3.1 Eligibility","Purchasers must have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms and comply with all applicable laws in their jurisdiction, including AML and KYC regulations. The Company may require identity verification and corporate documentation (e.g. certificate of incorporation, authorized signatory details) before allowing purchases.","3.2 Payment","Node Deeds may be purchased using cryptocurrencies (e.g. USDC) or fiat currencies as specified by the Company.","3.3 Delivery","Upon successful payment, the Node Deed will be delivered to the Purchaser’s designated wallet as an  ERC 721 non-fungible token (NFT). The Company is not responsible for losses due to incorrect wallet addresses, forgotten private keys, or other Purchaser errors.","3.4 No Token Generation Event (TGE)","For the avoidance of doubt, there is no Token Generation Event (TGE). There has not been, nor is there any intention for, a Token Generation Event (TGE) or Initial Coin/Token Offering (ICO/IDO) associated with the Ratio1 Protocol Token.","The Tokens are mined by the Purchasers of the Node Deeds through their active participation in the Ecosystem.","The Company does not issue, mint, or control the generation of Tokens.","The Node Deed license is available for purchase and enables the operation of individual edge nodes within the Ratio1 Protocol ecosystem. These nodes are essential for powering and maintaining the network's decentralized infrastructure.  The Node Deeds are emitted at a faster rate.","3.5. Price","The price of the Node Deed is determined by Us at Our sole discretion and displayed on the Platform at the time of purchase.","3.6. KYC/ AML Process","You hereby acknowledge and accept that a third-party KYC service provider may need to undertake certain KYC activities and/or AML verifications, including collecting certain personal data from You. Upon request, You shall provide all information and documents that are deemed necessary or appropriate to conduct KYC and/or AML verifications.","3.7. Limits","We may impose limits on the number of Node Deeds You may purchase. Such purchase limits, if any, will be determined in Our sole and absolute discretion and displayed to You on the Platform.","Any sale of Node Deeds is final and there are no cancellations. Once You have made a purchase of a Node Deed, you should promptly take the necessary steps to have a compatible  wallet where You will receive the Node Deed, within the terms and conditions stipulated in this document (e.g. activate or download any content or secure any seed phrase or corresponding private key).","4. Rights and Restrictions","4.1 License Grant","The Company grants Purchasers a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as permitted under Section 4.3), revocable license to use the Node Deed to operate a node within the Ratio 1 Protocol, subject to these Terms. The Node Deed must be installed on the Purchaser’s computer or other device on-premises, or cloud infrastructure to enable  the mining of Tokens.","4.2 Restrictions","The Purchasers shall not:","(i) Use Node Deeds for any unlawful purpose or in breach of these Terms;","(ii) Attempt to reverse-engineer, modify, or hack the Node Deed, Ratio 1 Protocol, or Ecosystem;","(iii) Represent Node Deeds as securities, investments, or financial instruments;","(iv) Use Node Deeds for speculative trading with an expectation of profit;","(v) Breach intellectual property rights or third-party rights while using Node Deeds.","4.3 Transferability","Node Deeds are transferable and tradeable on secondary market (e.g.: OpenSea marketplace), but once the license is coupled with the Ratio1 ecosystem dApp, the owner needs to pass the KYC/KYB.","4.4 Termination of License","The Company reserves the right to terminate a Purchaser’s license to use a Node Deed if the Purchaser breaches these Terms, engages in unlawful activity, or if the Company discontinues the Ratio 1 Protocol or Ecosystem. Upon termination, all rights granted under the Node Deed shall cease, and no refunds will be provided.","5. Declarations, acknowledgments and representations","5.1. The Purchaser understands and accepts that by purchasing the Node Deeds, the Purchaser must mine the Tokens. The Purchaser can use the Tokens in the Ecosystem only under the conditions outlined in the White Paper.","5.2. The Purchaser acknowledges and accepts that the Sale Node Deed is not being purchased for speculation purposes.","5.3. The Purchaser acknowledges and accepts that the Company shall ensure that a third-party KYC/AML service provider satisfactorily carries out identity verification through the Know Your Customer process and a verification process from an anti-money laundering perspective (the \"KYC/AML Process\") on the Purchaser to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.","5.4. The Purchaser, through its representative, expressly acknowledges and confirms that it has been thoroughly and comprehensively informed about the Node Deeds and has sought and obtained all technical, professional advice that it requires regarding the acquisition and use of the Node Deed.","5.5. The Purchaser, through its representative, acknowledges and confirms that it is fully aware of all the legal provisions and technical constraints relating to the purchase and use of the Node Deed,  and understands the nature, scope and limitations of the services from the Ecosystem.","5.6. The Purchaser is solely liable for determining the legal, accounting, financial and fiscal conditions, of whichever nature, applicable to it and to which it is required to comply in order to purchase and use the Node Deeds.","5.7. The Purchaser, through its representative, represents and warrants that the Purchaser:","(i) is solely and completely responsible for its own compliance with applicable legislation in its jurisdiction;","(ii)  is familiar with all related regulations in the specific jurisdiction in which it is based and that using the Node Deeds in that jurisdiction is not prohibited, restricted or subject to additional conditions of any kind;","(iii) does not have  the registered office in a jurisdiction that qualifies the Node Deeds as securities;","(iv) has the registered office in a jurisdiction that allows the Company to sell the Node Deeds without requiring any local authorization;","(v)   the acquisition and use of the Node Deeds does not breach any law, rule, or regulation applicable to it;","(vi) will not use the Node Deed for any illegal activity, including but not limited to money laundering and the financing of terrorism;","(vii) has not been placed on any of the sanctions lists, published and maintained by the United Nations, European Union, any EU state, UK, Treasury and US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC);","(viii) is not located in a geographic area that is subject to U.S., EU, OECD or other applicable sanctions or embargoes;","(ix) is not associated with an entity, identified on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals List, the U.S. Department of State’s Debarred Parties List or other applicable sanctions lists, in particular the EU or OECD-sanction lists;","(x) is not a resident of a geographic area in which holding or use of Node Deed is prohibited by applicable law, decree, regulation, treaty, or administrative act;","(xi)  is solely responsible for determining whether the acquisition of the Node Deed is appropriate for it;","(xii) is acquiring the Node Deed and will mine the Tokens exclusively for use of the Ecosystem;","(xiii)the acquisition and use of the Node Deed and the entrance in this Agreement shall not result in any breach of, be in conflict with, or constitute a material default under, with or without the passage of time or the giving of notice of: (i) any provision of the Purchaser’s organizational documents, if applicable; (ii) any provision of any judgment or order to which the Purchaser is a party, by which the Purchaser is bound, or to which any of the Purchaser’s material assets are subject; (iii) any material agreement, obligation, duty or commitment to which the Purchaser is a party or by which the Purchaser is bound; or (iv) any laws applicable to the Purchaser;","(xiv) The Purchaser represents that (i) it has satisfied itself as to the full observance of applicable law in connection with its entry into this Agreement, including the legal requirements within its jurisdiction for the entry into this Agreement and the acquisition of the Node Deed, any foreign exchange restrictions applicable to such purchase, (ii) the Purchaser has consulted with, and is relying solely upon the advice of, its own advisors relating to the income tax and other tax consequences, if any, that may be relevant to the purchase in this Agreement and with respect to the Node Deed and the mining of the Tokens.","5.8. Purchaser acknowledges that its representative has received all of the necessary details from the Company on the information and data they have communicated and it is therefore solely liable for the purchased Node Deed’s suitability in terms of their specific planned use.","5.9. Purchaser, through its representative, shall be the sole responsible for understanding the functioning mechanism of the blockchain technology, the process of using the Node Deed for mining the Tokens.","5.10. Purchaser acknowledges that buying the Node Deed and mining Tokens do not involve the purchase of shares, securities exchangeable into shares or any equivalent in any existing or future public or private company, corporation, or other entity in any jurisdiction. As per the Company's knowledge, the Node Deeds are not qualified as financial instruments and are not approved by any authority in the world; to avoid any misunderstanding, holding, using the Node Deed and mining Tokens do not offer to the Purchaser any right, including but not limited to any right to receive, exercise and, or request something in connection or from the Company's activity/revenues/profits or any other right which can qualify it as security.","5.11. Purchaser acknowledges that the Company is not responsible and will not be obliged, under any circumstances, to provide the Purchaser with any Tokens if the Purchaser does not mine the Tokens by using the Node Deed.","5.12. By the acquisition and use of the Node Deeds, You agree and represent that You will comply with all applicable legal provisions. You are not permitted to acquire Node Deeds or use  the Node Deeds if  by doing so You would, directly or indirectly, breach applicable legal provisions, which include but are not limited to those promulgated by the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), including but not limited to the Specially Designated Nationals (“SDN”) List and other non-SDN restricted or blocked parties lists), the European Union, the United Kingdom, and/or any other applicable national, regional, provincial, state, municipal or local laws and regulations.","5.13. Node Deeds are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as securities, as they are utility-based licenses. Purchasers acknowledge that Node Deeds do not meet the criteria of a security under the Howey Test or other applicable frameworks. In this respect, Node Deeds operate in a decentralized network where rewards are tied to individual node performance, not a centralized profit pool managed by the Company. Node Deeds are sold as utility licenses for operating nodes and mining Tokens through active participation. The Company does not promote Node Deeds as investment vehicles, and any rewards depend on the Purchaser’s computational efforts, not passive gains. Rewards from Node Deeds require active node operation by the Purchaser, not the Company or third parties. This distinguishes Node Deeds from securities, as profits are not derived solely from others’ efforts.","5.14.  US Purchasers are responsible for compliance with state-specific regulations that may apply to their activities with Node Deeds or Tokens.","5.15. U.S. Purchasers acknowledge that Node Deeds are acquired solely for their utility in operating nodes within the Ratio 1 Protocol to perform AI processing tasks and mine Tokens. The Company does not promote Node Deeds as investment opportunities, and any rewards are contingent on the Purchaser’s active participation, not passive income.","6. Intellectual Property Rights","This section outlines the intellectual property rights (\"IP Rights\") associated with the Node Deed, the Ratio 1 Protocol, the Ecosystem, the Website, the dApp, the Tools, and any related Services provided by the Company. These terms are designed to protect the Company’s proprietary assets while granting You, the purchaser of the Node Deed, limited rights necessary for the intended use of the Node Deed within the Ecosystem.","6.1. Ownership of Intellectual Property","All IP Rights, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, service marks, domain names, software code, know-how, designs, graphics, text, layouts, user interfaces, data compilations, source code, object code, databases, algorithms, and any other proprietary materials related to the Node Deed, the Ratio 1 Protocol, the Ecosystem, the Website, the dApp, the Tools, and the Services (collectively, the \"Company IP\"), are exclusively owned by the Company, its affiliates, or its licensors.

The Tokens are distributed and mined through the Naeural Edge Nodes paired with the Node Deeds licenses and can be claimed through the dApp.","(iii) The Tokens are the Naeural Protocol utility tokens that are mined by the holders of the licenses defined above as Node Deeds, and distributed through the Node Deeds and the Naeural Edge Node via the management features of the dApp. The  Node  Deed must be installed by each participant in the Ecosystem on their computer or computers, on-premises or on cloud infrastructures. Based on the license type (Node Deed) held by each participant in the Ecosystem, each participant is entitled to use the Naeural Protocol and can mine Tokens through providing AI compute power.","For the avoidance of any doubt, there is no Token Generation Event (TGE), each participant in the Ecosystem generates the Tokens through mining. The Company is not performing any actions in relation to the issuance of the Tokens and the Company does not exercise any control on the Tokens’ generation. The Tokens aim to fulfill several purposes and functionalities within the Ecosystem, as stated in the White Paper.","The Tokens are mined by the participants in the Ecosystem/ holders of the Node Deeds, they are not minted or otherwise issued by the Company.","The Company has no intention of acting as a broker, dealer, or crypto exchange, directly or indirectly, in relation to any transaction involving  Tokens.","5.Access and use of the Website, Ecosystem and Services","As a condition to accessing or using the Website, Ecosystem and the Services, You:","a) shall only use the Website, dApp, Node Deed, Tools, Tokens and the Services for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms;","b) shall comply with all applicable national and international legal provisions and regulations applicable to Your use of the Website, dApp, Node Deed, Tools, Tokens respectively the Services;","c) shall not breach the applicable legal provisions by using the Website, respectively the Ecosystem and the Services;","d) shall ensure that all information that You provide on any form (including but not limited to information related to Your e-mail address, company name, Your name, public address) is true, complete, current and accurate;","e) shall  not  directly or indirectly do or state anything that might affect the Website, dApp’s and/ or the team members’ reputation and/or image, as well as the evolution and development of the Website, dApp and Services, including but not limited to any behavior which may be considered by Us as being defamatory, either directly or indirectly, by whatever means or words or place of communication, or being a manipulatory behavior either by suggestions, affirmations, rhetoric or inadequate questions or postings which may subversively affect  the reputation, image or future development of the Website, dApp or the team members;","f) shall not misappropriate any intellectual property or third-party’s rights while using the Website, respectively the Ecosystem, the Tools and the Services;","g) shall not misrepresent the truthfulness, sourcing or reliability of any content on the Website, dApp;","h) shall not use the Website, respectively the Ecosystem in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Website respectively the Ecosystem, respectively the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Website in any manner;","i) shall not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface not provided by Us, to access the Website, respectively the Services, to extract data;","j) shall not attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques or security measures that We employ on the Website, dApp, or attempt to access any area of the Website, dApp, that You are not authorized to access;","k) shall not introduce any malware, virus, Trojan horse, worm, logic bomb, drop-dead device, backdoor, shutdown mechanism or other harmful material into the Website, respectively the Ecosystem;","l) shall not upload or transmit (or attempt to upload or to transmit) any material that acts as a passive or active information collection or transmission mechanism in the Website.","6.
